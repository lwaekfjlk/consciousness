I am the owner and I approve this message.\n\nExplain the joke/how the caption relates to the cartoon in 2-3 sentences.", "response": "Here's my best explanation: A play on US political ads where a person would say \"I am the candidate and I approve this message.\" The restaurant owner is speaking about their own restaurant, promoting the ratatouille dish but adopting the political tone and phrasing.", "instance_id": "f76724ef7ef8f1e6a129299d0915e33e"}

The person is literally getting stuck in a door, but instead of being concerned about the person and their well-being, the caption implies that the surgeon is frustrated and callous enough that he's willing to let the man sue him. The pun is humorous partly because it shifts the cause of the person's injury to the surgeon, and recasts the phrase \"so sue me\" from being used defiantly, to being used flippantly from someone in a position of power.", "instance_id": "fbc802c4bfecde233bd251f55d34965f"}

A therapist's office usually has a couch for the patient to lay on, and in this case it's red and quite overt. The joke involves a mixup with the homophones couch and cliche type of ear-related specialist seating the psychiatrist deems is best for the patient. The joke is also mildly humorous because a specialty earmuff-stand-in for the usual red couch to \"ear\" out your problems is harder to imagine.", "instance_id": "c04f0ea8fe63b07a5df7049e11e10d64"}

The whimsical idea is that the moon is just another neighborhood in which a couple is discussing the events that happen on another nearby globe. It's a play on the implications of the moon's supposed inaccessibility (i.e. if people live there, the world below might be post-apocalyptic).", "instance_id": "8d4eeb850040d4e9ad6cd1f6a822ebba"}

The joke is that one of the characters is clearly not human, as he has a monkey tail hanging out of his suit. The caption is a deflection line. It's not directly related to the uncanny imagery in the cartoon, but the implication is that the topic of conversation between these two men has been somehow absurd or unlikely, such as convincing the Kansas Board of Education of something ridiculous.", "instance_id": "62d6e453b0c5793cc7561495dff1c268"}

The lizard in the cartoon is a twist on the idea of prehistoric animals, which might have been present in the time when these cave paintings were made, and suggests that the \"value\" of this particular piece of cave art will increase astronomically when its unlikely artist goes extinct and can no longer be seen.", "instance_id": "bb62359695999a889c9d9a0aa241059f"}

Here, the joke is that the woman doesn't have to go outside in order to get a tan because the man has constructed a box around him to produce a artificial tanning environment.

But, in this cartoon, the cows are waiting in what appears to be a cow-themed living room; the humor comes from using this common catchphrase in a very unusual context like a waiting room filled with cows, but with no evidence that the cows (who have no reason to care) were interested in improving the aesthetics of their environment.", "instance_id": "2d05d5b24710aacf3e86ca24d8d13e99"}

Here, Death is depicted as offering food to a man as a way of easing into his duties as the harbinger of human mortality. However, instead of kindly words of wisdom, Death offers the advice to not make lemonade out of the fruit he was given, which is otherwise a common use for excess lemons.", "instance_id": "1bc8b1cae1a728b65b340d4d0a64b39d"}

In love, one's partner is often described as \"the one that got away,\" a person for whom one had romantic feelings, but who ultimately rejected or left that person. In this case, the phrase is taken literally, to mean that this song is dedicated to a fish that the pianist was unable to catch in a fish pond. The dead fish inside the piano suggest that the fish was indeed caught, but then perished. The image is funny because the pianist is so committed to this fish, which he ultimately failed to keep alive, and will play a serious song for this deceased creature.", "instance_id": "66a89c109ebed9e5e2297f4604f3cb8a"}

If you were told of a story in which an esteemed brain surgeon was operating on a rocket, rather than the more typical human brain, they might mutter, \"Damn it, I'm a brain surgeon, not a rocket scientist!\" The humor lies in the reversal of roles the surgeon is placed in compared to their usual operating procedures.", "instance_id": "d863b91cd930613db3cf30d8ea77827f"}

The joke is that, while these people are technically adults, the adult equivalent of recess is apparently going down the slide at a playground.

This pirate is offering a traditional offshore account for them to proverbially bury their treasure, an old pirate term that means to hide your loot from other pirates after you robbed them.

A bartender is answering the phone, perhaps the caller is trying to find their friend or partner who left earlier. However, in this case the caller has called their train by accident, further cementing the fact that the trains are depressed and lonely because they don't have control over when they leave - they just sit in the same place all day long.", "instance_id": "ec5e40d4da9df6ad15edb008fafdc438"}

The phrase \"let's flip this house\" usually refers to buying a house, making some strategic repairs and redecorations, and then profiting off of the sale. However, here the phrase \"flipping\" takes on a double meaning --- the couple is both flipping (hanging upside down) in the house, while also hoping to sell the property and \"flip\" it as an asset.", "instance_id": "441a301318afcafa6fa767269879ab49"}

Alleged killer whale.\n\nExplain the joke/how the caption relates to the cartoon in 2-3 sentences.", "response": "Here's my best explanation: The phrase \u2018killer whale\u2019 has a double meaning in this context --- it refers both to this specific whale, who is being accused of a crime, and to the species of whale that is known more generally as a killer whale. The punchline, \"objection, Your Honor! Alleged killer whale,\" is a play on words: If one is \"alleged\" to have done something, it means that there is an accusation or charge. But, the whale species called \"killer whale\" is not known for killing humans, so to call it an \"alleged\" killer whale is funny because it's unlikely that this whale did anything but swim around.", "instance_id": "ad8416d0ad37088d007058217307ded5"}

The phrase \"wearing protection\" usually brings to mind condoms or other forms of birth control, not armor, so the joke element here comes with the humorous juxtaposition of that mental image with the armor.

Here, the joke relies on the conceit that the guests have all been impaled by their host's practice spear-throwing session in the 'background' of the cave mural. The man\u2019s use of 'wore' is the punch line, as it usually means wearing an item of clothing, but in this case he means the spear injury.", "instance_id": "552417b0aca1c11f1355c796ed1eb389"}

Usually people ask a couple who are dating when they are going to get married (i.e. take the plunge). But here, the people are physically restrained with ropes, and the woman asking the question seems to be ignoring that fact. The absurdity of the scene is both in the restraint and that the woman is making completely unrelated small-talk in a socially abnormal setting.", "instance_id": "c69915fb819fec8eab393b3bfcfcc926"}

These dolls feature dolls of decreasing sizes inside of one another and originally come from Russia.

However, they \"uncoupled\" and the train drinker is now alone, having been \"left behind\" so to speak. It's funny that the anthropomorphized train is sobbing and drinking at the bar (anthropomorphic objects are usually not depicted in this way, as it is unsettling).", "instance_id": "31fe9f541b364a237d3af4626fd820a9"}

Here, the man is apparently trying to simulate so many kinds of vacations (camping, scuba diving, sword fighting) that he just looks insane.

If the umbrella is so big that it covers the entire sidewalk, it's impossible to tell if it's raining or not.

This woman seems to have such technology --- her companion is, in fact, a crash-test dummy, i.e., with durable and reliable joints that allow it to be put to the strain of safety testing purposes. Even the elderly men passing by are impressed by her technology; one man admits that he'd like to have \"those knees\" himself.

The implication is that, as part of testing drugs for humans, the pharmaceutical companies have tried things that are even more outrageous and cruel than giving fake wings to a rat.

The caption reveals that \"Dopey,\" one of the seven dwarfs, has gotten an impressive job in the White House.

The mouse is not familiar because it is not frequently seen outside rodent-heavy areas, but is assuring the waiter that it is a regular anyway.

Instead of being somewhere where surfing would be a normal activity, like a beach, the man is in an office waiting room.

The empty suit in the courtroom can be explained in two ways: either the person being questioned is a metaphorical \"empty suit\" --- a politician or company spokesperson who doesn't have very meaningful or accountable answers --- or the person is literally invisible, either through advanced technology, magic, or a hypothetical ability to remain hidden.

In a job interview scenario such as this one, the human being is now the one asking the questions, and the angry bull is on the defensive.

The caption trades on the fact that the actual car received is tiny and useless --- newborns can't operate a car.

Oftentimes, politicians are required to give speeches and hand-wave their talking points at podiums all day, and the joke is that the man has been up for so long doing this that he has now passed out in his bed with the podium still on top of him (which would be uncomfortable). The \"fake applause\" joke is likely a reference to the fact that politicians will often prompt the audience to clap for them (e.g. \"let's give a round of applause!\") and this prompts people to clap even if the speech wasn't that great.", "instance_id": "d8762af641766f0a23625cd24bd8db31"}

Here, the joke is that it's unclear which of the two people the caption is referring to as the missing link.

Instead of saying the typical \"You will feel a pinch,\" which suggests that the needle is not going to bother the patient, the caption reveals that the doctor is in fact going to actually hurt the patient with the massive needle he's holding.

The bird is ideally the last thing you would want to be talking to in this situation: it's not going to give the suicidal person advice, nor can it do anything to help. In fact, the bird is a domestic pigeon, a type of bird that doesn't build nests: the man's naive suggestion that he'll teach the bird reveals his current state of mind and mental instability.", "instance_id": "b867de433e9b1a9a3a208a6140b2428e"}

In the cartoon, the staff at the restaurant are taking the toast seriously as if it's a real person making a reservation.

The joke is that the people around him don't seem to be impressed or enjoying themselves anymore, and he himself is too focused on the vlogging and capturing footage that he's missed out on the experience of being there live with his friends.

The question the bird is asking (and we are left to assume it's asking its partner), pokes fun at pet ownership by wondering whether it's setting a bad example for their offspring.

A parachuting man is unlikely to use a laptop, and the office-style clothing he wears is borrowed from specific folklore---he resembles D.B. Cooper, a notorious thief who became famous in the 70s for hijacking an airplane. The joke refers to the idiom \"cloud nine,\" which means feeling elated.

The joke here is that the bull at the bar is also half-man, and he is referencing a mythological event as though it's a mundane thing that happens to him (\"if I'm not back at the maze by eight..\").

The caption is a play on the idiom \"I'll move Heaven and Earth (i.e., do everything in my power) to help you out\", but he has already moved the Earth, so he's joking he'll move Heaven next to help her.

Here, giraffes are humanized by their positioning in human furniture (a couch) and watching human TV as if they're people. The humor in the caption is that the excuse of traffic lights is given, but the excuse is funny because a giraffe driving a car hitting traffic lights is an absurd visual.", "instance_id": "2856394f8ed2dced2bb13b0a09032bad"}

The takeover was \"hostile\" because the executives who were pushed out did not wish to stop the takeover.

In this case, the squid is to blame for the destruction on the bridge full of people, but the driver can excuse himself from this accountability since he voted for the \"other thing\" that is unnamed.

The caption refers to the fact that, in the original fairy tale, the prince had short hair and used Rapunzel's long hair to climb up into the tower.

They feel that they are manipulating each other, and through the puppets, they can avoid manipulating each other indirectly. The joke is in this absurd use of puppets in what is supposed to be a serious counseling session, highlighting the complexity of relationships.", "instance_id": "50ddba203ec26cf7afcd90298303cc04"}

By suggesting that they come from the artistic process of painting or etching, the joke hints towards the visual appeal of the pianos.

In this cartoon, a group of people are gathered, watching TV, and it seems that they are loving what they are seeing, but the woman is so excited that she seems potentially insane. The joke is that this group therapy -- watching TV together -- seems to be having the opposite effect on the woman, and thus she's gleefully yelling while everyone else is calm.", "instance_id": "7e18b92f52f0e80f704c4d7eca2eb6ad"}

Maybe we are being too defensive.\n\nExplain the joke/how the caption relates to the cartoon in 2-3 sentences.", "response": "Here's my best explanation:  Psychiatrists usually say to \"just hear out\" the patient before making a judgment. Here, the players are taking this advice literally, inviting a writer to discuss their defensive game, which is faltering. Additionally, \"defensive\" might be interpreted as relating to personal defense or ego which can be issues discussed in therapy, making the joke more clever.", "instance_id": "e4e06cb9e9f79a767866899579b1e77c"}

We don't test on animals.\n\nExplain the joke/how the caption relates to the cartoon in 2-3 sentences.", "response": "Here's my best explanation: This joke is a play on the common phrase \"we don't test on animals\" that companies say while testing on animals, by insinuating we are now testing on people instead.

The caveman in this cartoon says that he is a painter-gatherer, which is a twist on this old phrase. Instead of collecting food, he is occupied with art and collecting pigment for his cave paintings, suggesting he is a bit primitive compared to his peers who are successfully hunting.", "instance_id": "69871b70078563b085418c0959220ff5"}

Since the plumber is emerging from the ocean onto the island, there's an incongruity since plumbers typically wouldn't have jobs to do on an island. Thus the phrase \"there's water everywhere\" takes on a double meaning --- both in the literal sense (since the plumber is coming in from the ocean), and humorously (since water is the last thing the woman in the cartoon needs right now).", "instance_id": "ed9db65e81f72ac5a696ac2185210696"}

The twist on the caption regards the modern idea of 'growing up': here, the prince is 35 years old and still believes in this fairy-tale-ending, asking Dave to escape.

In this case, the fish on the plaque is a popular decoration known as Big Mouth Billy Bass. Billy Bass is considered tacky and something people often want to get out of their house, so this is a pun on the phrase catch-and-release that works in two ways: that the fish is being put back into the ocean (released) as well as getting rid of something considered low-brow (kitsch).", "instance_id": "d861f31bd813076a60066f1738b7e11a"}

Here, the man was reading a \"big book\" and either his arm was really cut off or he received a paper cut. Either way, he apparently overreacted and stopped reading altogether. The fact that the book is so large, which itself is comical, reinforces the idea that the man's overreaction is ridiculous.", "instance_id": "8b3e8714f1c85a9a5f689f9bab5ccb2d"}

This might suggest that he's there to collect souls of someone who died doing an athletic/gym-related activity.

One can imagine a caveman finding an intriguing round object (a wheel) and needing a place to store or park it, and the man wanting to protect his asset by building a small house or garage around the wheel. But of course, wheels would not have had much utility in a pre-modern human's life anyway, so the idea is humorous and nonsensical.", "instance_id": "0a511b2d83360be25bb2194965be28db"}

The joke here is that when you work a job for so long that it seems to be your whole life (in this case, spending the night in an office cubicle instead of a home), even the bed seems like just another part of the work station.

Asking a difficult but innocuous question (like \"Do YOU remember what you had for lunch last Thursday?\") is intended to put the shark off-balance to extract more information.", "instance_id": "f6fd54fc17e9f1dacc50eb6d10043aea"}

The woman in the cartoon is fearful because the baseball player has thrown the ball inside the house.

Though the trees have faces like we might carve into a log, none are being lumberjacked. The reference to the \"look\" just indicates that it is a style choice, rather than an occupation nowadays.

Here, the central figure is not buried; and the caption implies that the child who dug the holes and buried the others will be coming back to bury him. The joke comes in the twist that it is not actually the \"kid with the little red shovel\" (whom the people on the beach may fear), but instead, the central figure has misinterpreted the impending danger.", "instance_id": "f48cff47b694bb32e1f2b0792e0664ea"}

His calmness suggests that he is not surprised by it, but he still hasn't read the note, and he's on the phone with someone else. This suggests that he knows there is a note there and what it is about, but he still has yet to read it.

But in this case, the patient is floating in the air, stripped down to his underwear because he's not affected by gravity. The joke is that the funny voice could be the result of being weightless; but on the other hand, being weightless could be the result of going into space, which could also affect one's speech from the change in atmosphere.", "instance_id": "4eda7dc0a43e81925b1361655969b378"}

This phrase is often used when someone feels guilty about doing something wrong. In this situation, the joke is referring to God watching over us all the time -- even during routine check-ups at the doctor. God's hand appears to be large to demonstrate that He is clearly looking over the doctor's shoulder. The joke is that God is worrying too much!", "instance_id": "ae5706b629fd8e3fd42369638ac14849"}

The note about \"a hot barrel of coffee\" suggests that the people in the office are not bothered by the enormous stationery, but they might as well be using a hot barrel of coffee in place of the giant pencils, visually.

The man is not interested in more snakes, but rather more stakeholders. The humor comes from his misinterpretation of the situation and from the setup where you'd expect him to be concerned about the giant snake and whether it was an order mixup.", "instance_id": "a6ac36d8aa2cb77ad26b31c2e92c36bb"}

The woman misses the exercise class she used to take, contrasting it to the strange and uncomfortable sight of people inside laundry machines spinning around as if they were on a stationary bike.", "instance_id": "06c299120d91c4bf8c87efec32a42231"}

This man in a ridiculous bunny suit is clearly not dressed modestly, and his costume doesn't match the occasion, but he might be wearing it to remember Good Friday in a \"casual\" way.

The \"Fantastic Four\" is a comic book group of superheroes known for impressive abilities (like Mr. Fantastic's power of stretching), suggesting that the waiter's arm is exaggeratedly long.

The cop-in-disguise is able to infiltrate the mob meeting due to his horse adding to the ambiance of the already suspicious meeting, and he takes advantage of this fact that is acknowledged in the caption.", "instance_id": "85337a5d3c4ce8321d0d475a290f0a1e"}

As with many therapy sessions, the patient is revealing intimate details about their innermost thoughts, which is interuptted when the patient feels uncomfortable that his fish is present.

The image of the man cut into three parts is certainly surreal, and is made even more surreal by the fact that he's alive and speaking with the doctor.

It's most commonly used in psychology; forcing someone to interpret it one way or another can give insight into personality or perspective. In this cartoon, a shadow puppet of a rabbit is made while a doctor takes a physical examination, and the caption jokingly wonders if the patient will try to trick the doctor into thinking it is a different animal.", "instance_id": "849b7df56515821363e69c482b6beebe"}

In this case, the figurines are people who have climbed onto the top of the meeting table, and the speaker --- also a tiny figurine --- would like them to use coasters so as not to leave a mark on the table.

The man is a politician with his election campaign bus in his driveway. The woman might be a potential voter who is feeling insecure, and so the man suggests that his wife will be the one actually doing the work instead of him.

The jacket, being given to Moses on a mountaintop, seems as though it is a new commandment, but instead it is a suggestion from God, encouraging Moses to dress warmly.

Since this pair is together with their necks tangled up, one of them makes a joking reference to their twisted necks, as if they are meant to be tangled together as long as they are together.", "instance_id": "7238595a20a9d17437c2973a91613e14"}

In many movies, one of the signs of a successful person is displaying a mounted fish (usually a trophy of a great catch). Here, though, that fish is not just mounted but still alive, and it's not going after a small fish, but one of the men's suits.

The presence of the dog is implied by the distinctive size and style of the chain, and the fact that the person at the door has a package to deliver, so the humor here is that the recipient of the package seems to be warning the mailman to let the dog have its way if it starts acting up.", "instance_id": "92addd4b9c92836a377b83b4b4911035"}

Here, the organ in question is a pipe organ, and the pipes are oversized relative to the seating of the organist.

But the man is clearly a person because he's on an island, waving a palm frond, i.e., he's a human castaway. The humor is that the woman has misunderstood what kind of creature the man is, in part because he's in a store that mostly has fish and other pet species.", "instance_id": "0c7c6ac50a9fd6486bb7286a6c77b920"}

The tamer's co-workers are calling him not to talk to him, but to get him in trouble with his boss. It's unrealistic to imagine an animal speaking on the phone, and the contrast between the dangerous situation in the foreground with the silly phone call in the background contributes to the humorous effect.", "instance_id": "a79aecc386e83d128bcb6c5b693ef6e8"}

Here, the jokester is playing with the idea that, despite the size of the chameleon, the lizard claims to have been present in the doctor's office, without being noted by the staff.

The fuzzy yellow refers to how baby chicks look when they're hatching from eggs, which is reminiscent of what human interns might look like when they're new.", "instance_id": "420f9629e1fbebf9fdaa481c151088a2"}

A common source of anxiety for patients is whether their insurance will cover the costs of necessary treatment.

In the cartoon, a person is doing the same task but the woman in the scene is out of place time-wise--- she's at a bar table drinking.

It's funny in this cartoon because not only is it a rat (and it's weird to see a rat reading the newspaper, let alone a huge one), but it's also possible that he's not even reading, just staring at the pictures, because the people didn't think he could read.

The idea of the Hulk trying to do yoga is ridiculous (given the fact that he is always angry and unable to control himself.)

Yet, the sword in this particular image looks very handsome, cooler even than a pen.

This can be cleared up by the caption which implies that the man's office is garden-to-table, and is planting things for the upcoming business quarter that will later be ingested as food.

The woman is probably a goat farmer trying to sell her goats (since she has a bag), and the goat on the man's lap, who is shocked at the goats' leaving, is probably thinking about the loss of his source of future sweaters.

In these situations, victims are sometimes weighted down by cement shoes: here, they've followed the instructions of their bosses to tie up the victim and weight him down, but then realize belatedly that they've forgotten to find a body of water to dispose of him in.

Here, the \"X\" is golf; the man is arguing that because they \"believe in golf\" (i.e. it's important to them), they can't stop playing even when surrounded by tanks.

Here, one of the snakes has a \"human\" butt, and accuses the other snake of betraying them (by talking to Adam, perhaps), which mirrors the Serpent's role in the biblical narrative.", "instance_id": "c8a52a693d69ec46592831ea592d67d1"}

The man dressed as a king represents Harry, who has been vocal about his desire to live a more normal life. The caption plays on the idea that, despite his intentions, he is still drawing attention to himself by dressing like a king in public and not blending in.", "instance_id": "c113550f5ec8378089129ab98ad0182e"}

Here, the person has his friend wrapped around him in a safe, which is an unusual way to transport someone during a flight. The caption is funny because the man is complaining that the safe is not his luggage, which implies that this isn't a leisure trip, it's a business trip where this type of transport is mandated.", "instance_id": "70071924e6b209e8fb0726e1c3dc751e"}

Perhaps there are some supernatural or demonic happenings going on in the house, and the man is in need of a specialized plumber/exorcist.", "instance_id": "294fa8d32e184ce96c21f952cfe6b194"}

In this case, one partner is being (or has been) buried in a coffin while the other is a skeleton, implying they had died before their partner. The joke is that the vow is still technically true, even though they are now in an eternal sleep in coffins.", "instance_id": "967b12adff2de58bc09c146fc902b7de"}

It's funny since none of the typical painful procedures are things that would be conducted under a magnifying glass. It seems as if the doctor is expecting to see something like a microscopic rash.

The chair not only is a ominous warning to underperforming workers, but also goes beyond the expected gamut of office incentives, making the joke all the more surprising and funny.", "instance_id": "699df80953a592040af6c3f9255ec4f4"}

By all accounts, the man has floated/levitated up to the ceiling because of these consuming helium.

So the speaker seems to be poking fun at the ability of the military to attract anyone to their fighting forces, since they have resorted to fragging \"civilians\".

The couple is trying to get their stalled automobile running again. But instead of looking for a tow truck or other assistance, they are trying to row the car using oars like a boat. The humor comes in part from how the solution looks really ineffective and hopeless, but also because adding children to this scene wouldn't make it easier nor better.", "instance_id": "ed8198a39e9b52f24b9dc20c830f78b9"}

The egg is going to hatch into a baby that is not the man's child, and the woman might have cheated on him with a different person.

The joke is that the conductor's focus on marching doesn't extend to taking care of his human counterparts' basic survival needs. The punchline, \"I'm thinking about quitting the band,\" is a play on words, because normally people quit a marching band, not just a \"band\" of people in a desert.", "instance_id": "d812f801c8ee87491ea50a3e46cfeedc"}

Since the other man is completely covered with birds it suggests that he may have been loose with some bird-feeding earlier that day, and birds who have had food given to them will continue to follow humans that fed them because of a natural process called imprinting.
