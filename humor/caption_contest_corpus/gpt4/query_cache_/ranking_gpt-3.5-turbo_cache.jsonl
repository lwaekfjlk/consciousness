The wordplay here draws a parallel between a person stealing someone's identity and a wild animal in the office, both of which are unusual and disruptive. \n\nCaption B, on the other hand, employs irony to evoke humor. The speaker is implying that the presence of a tiger sitting on top of the filing cabinet is a normal sight that they will miss once the company goes paperless. The humor in this caption comes from the juxtaposition of an exotic and dangerous animal with an everyday office occurrence. \n\nOverall, I think the humor in Caption A is more successful, in part because of it being more unexpected - the idea of identity theft is not immediately connected to a tiger in an office setting.

There is no overt humor or joke present in this caption, so it seems less likely to be the winning caption.\n\nTherefore, based on the above analysis, I conclude that Option A is funnier and was most likely selected as the winning caption. \n\nAnswer: A", "instance_id": "5e99fc5d043336f1d2e30aaf0ee56dbf"}

However, neither of the captions seems to fit this theory very well.\n\nRelief theory suggests that humor can be a form of release from tension or anxiety. In this case, the tension may come from the unexpected scenario of a chandelier being caught while fishing. Both captions seem to offer a bit of relief, but again, neither one stands out as being particularly funny.\n\nFinally, incongruity theory suggests that humor arises from the unexpected and surprising connections between seemingly unrelated things. \n\nLooking at the two captions, \"I hate fishing in the Hamptons\" seems like it is simply commenting on the location, but does not create any unexpected or surprising connections. On the other hand, \"she got everything else in the divorce\" creates a connection between the strange occurrence of a chandelier being caught while fishing and a personal narrative about a divorce. This connection seems more unexpected and therefore could be seen as more humorous.\n\nSo, Answer: B, \"she got everything else in the divorce\" is likely the funnier of the two captions, as it better fits the incongruity theory of humor.", "instance_id": "56c10e826163c90b6ef5b25b5a755b88"}

Here's why:\n\nCaption Option A seems like a standard medical question that one doctor would ask their patient. It doesn't engage with any of the cartoon's visuals, and the humor is dependent on the fact that a cowboy is receiving modern medical treatment. This is a clever juxtaposition, but not particularly laugh-out-loud funny.\n\nOn the other hand, Caption Option B manages to merge modern medicine with cowboy language in a smart play on words. The phrase \u201carrow count\u201d is a reference to the number of arrows in his body, but also sounds like a cowboy measuring his cattle. This creates a witty caption that relates to both of the cartoon's entities and utilizes wordplay. \n\nConsidering these factors, I'd say that Caption B was selected as the funnier one. \n\nAnswer: B", "instance_id": "21e70245a7e4945d6e36432e4637496a"}

Think step-by-step and finish your response with \"Answer: X\" where X is either A or B.", "response": "Both options are amusing, but Option B is likely the funnier of the two. Here's my reasoning:\n\nOption A is funny because it provides a clever interpretation of the banana's presence: instead of a person, the banana is the patient that has been metaphorically \"bruised\" by psychotherapy. It's a play on the fruit's physical vulnerability to bruising. However, while it's a clever wordplay, it's not necessarily laugh-out-loud funny.\n\nOption B, on the other hand, adds an unexpected twist to the situation. Instead of simply acknowledging the banana's presence, it attributes an emotional response to it, implying that the banana is depressed about its current state. The phrase \"the split\" is a play on words that refers both to the banana's physical state, and a term used to describe emotional breaks between people. Combining those two meanings makes for a humorous literary device. Option B, then, adds a clever comment to the situation in a way that is both silly and surprising, which are two hallmarks of good New Yorker cartoon captions.\n\nOverall, while both options are clever, Option B adds more humor to the scenario and would likely be better received by the contest judges and readers.\n\nAnswer: B.", "instance_id": "b42471ad25a02e4da3978b50515c7257"}

However, the humor in this caption is more subtle and requires the reader to think a bit more.\n\nCaption B, on the other hand, is more overtly humorous. It uses a phrase typically associated with beauty pageants (\"talent portion\") to describe the caveman's juggling act, creating a humorous juxtaposition between the two. This caption also has a surprising twist, because the reader might expect the caption to comment on the dangerousness of juggling torches, but instead it comments on the caveman's ability to perform the trick.\n\nOverall, I think that caption B is the stronger of the two because it is more immediately and obviously funny.

However, the caption focuses more on the idea of a court jester rather than the cat being dressed as a king. It also seems a little bit predictable, as it directly relates to the visual of the cat as a royal. \n\nStep 3: Analyzing caption option B\nThe caption \"His videos bought this house. He deserves a little respect\" is a humorous take on the idea of pets being successful media influencers. The phrase \"His videos bought this house\" is unexpected and leads the reader to believe the cat has somehow achieved great wealth or fame. The caption also provides a good contrast between the fancy attire of the cat and the more mundane reality of the couple's living situation.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\nOf the two caption options, \"His videos bought this house.

First, the cartoon's setting is in a forest, and one of the beavers is chewing on a tree. Secondly, the tree is left with its middle cut, but it still doesn't fall. Keeping in mind these details, let's compare the two captions.\n\nOption A, \"Damn Republicans - another entitlement taken away,\" seems to be trying to make a political joke that is somewhat related to the idea of logging or cutting nature resources. However, the reference to entitlement does not directly relate to the cartoon's elements, and it feels slightly out of place and forced. \n\nOption B, \"It won't fall until we're not around to hear it,\" is a humorously twisted phrase on the classic question of \"If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?\" The beavers are cutting down the tree but can't see it fall, so they make a witty remark on whether it's truly fallen. The humor of this caption connects directly to the scene, making it a clever and witty observation.\n\nConsidering the above analysis, it seems that Option B is the funnier caption that humans preferred.

It suggests that the man has a history of sleepwalking and eating snacks, and implies that the cat has had to intervene in the past. The idea that the man's sleepwalking is an important endeavor that has to be carefully evaluated makes the caption amusing and unexpected. \n\nOption B, on the other hand, doesn't connect as well to the image.

However, Caption A provides a more direct connection to the specifics of the image, and the concept of reality-show bug-eating is a more relatable element to modern audiences than an arcane reference to evolutionary theory.\n\nTherefore, Answer: A.", "instance_id": "22d46ceea0e1af16c7e76f3de35d2ab0"}

It suggests that the woman's behavior was a misunderstanding, as if the therapist had meant something else when they used the metaphor \"planting new roots\".

The use of the word \"scarf\" rather than something else unexpected could make this caption less funny.\n\nCaption B is a pun, which plays on the phrase \"Hell's Angels\" which is a motorcycle gang known for its rebellious attitude. PETA is a well known animal rights group, and the combination of these two ideas in a single phrase is unexpected and humorous.\n\nOverall, Caption B is a more original and unexpected caption choice, and it combines two disparate concepts in an ironic way, which humans often find funny.

This caption is more clever and unexpected, and is therefore the more humorous option.\n\nTherefore, my answer is: B.", "response": "Final Answer: B", "instance_id": "13a9cd4178a1b52cb370e10b0a658f4b"}
{"query": "To compare and analyze the funniness of each caption, I'll first break down the elements and context of each option: \n\nCaption A references the famous song \"New York, New York\" by Frank Sinatra, but changes \"New York\" to \"here\" to fit the setting of the cartoon. The caption plays with the idea of the bird being an aspiring musician trying to make it big in the \"nest\" or \"here.\" \n\nCaption B makes a pun with the word \"hummingbird.\" The caption suggests that the bird used to only hum but can now play guitar and sing, demonstrating a progression in its musical ability. \n\nConsidering the context of the cartoon, I believe Caption A fits better. The bird is anthropomorphized to play music in a comedy setting, and the humor lies in the bird's ambition to become a musician. Caption B seems less related to the cartoon, though it still utilizes wordplay. \n\nTherefore, the Answer is A.", "response": "Final Answer: A", "instance_id": "8273fa2dde7786fdb6541865e21dfb1b"}
{"query": "Alright, let's analyze both the captions in detail and see which one is funnier.\n\nCaption A: \"I really thought he'd leave after the election.\"\nThis caption makes a reference to the idiom \"the elephant in the room\", which refers to a topic or problem that people are aware of but purposely ignore. In this case, the elephant is a literal elephant in the room, but the caption plays off of the idiom to create humor. The joke is that the man and woman were aware that the elephant would be there, but they thought it would leave after the election - a humorous political reference. This caption is clever and unexpected, and it plays on the well-known idiom, so it has the potential to be funny.\n\nCaption B: \"Why can't you just wear a button, like most people?\"\nThis caption makes no reference to the idiom \"the elephant in the room\". Instead, it critiques the woman's decision not to wear a button, perhaps suggesting that the button would acknowledge the presence of the elephant. This caption is less likely to be funny as it doesn't play on any existing humorous elements of the cartoon.\n\nTherefore, the humorous caption is option A: \"I really thought he'd leave after the election.\" The reference to the political situation combined with the idiom creates a clever joke that is likely to be funny to a wider audience.", "response": "Final Answer: A", "instance_id": "4275f601df1fea039409fd5bc89d12b5"}

While the situation in the cartoon might not directly relate to infidelity, the caption does a good job of making a humorous connection between the two. The second caption, \"I guess it really did kill you to call.\" doesn't seem to directly relate to the situation in the cartoon, and the humor behind the caption doesn't seem as strong as the first caption.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is: A.", "response": "Final Answer: A", "instance_id": "b86ed88b917018ee438d131927141997"}

On the other hand, Option B (\"I thought Ferguson hated quicksand\") is more of a non-sequitur, trying to connect an unexpected character reference to quicksand. \n\nConsidering the context of the cartoon, and the fact that the explanation in Option A fits better with the absurdity in the image, humans would find it funnier.

This caption plays on the fact that the elephant character has no chance of winning the contest due to its non-human nature. \n\nWhile both jokes have their merits, I think that the more universally relatable and clever wordplay of Choice A is likely to be the funnier choice.

{"query": "Both captions are clever, but \"B: I take it you don\u2019t share the same bed.\" is funnier.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n- The person waiting in the chair seems stuck to the wall, which is an unusual detail that draws attention.\n- Caption A: \"He's part of the oversight committee.\" relies on the idea that the man on the wall is somehow monitoring the interview process. Although there is a play on words, the connection between the image and the caption is not immediately clear.\n- Caption B: \"I take it you don\u2019t share the same bed.\" is a reference to the idea of divorce or legal separation, which could be what the interview is about. The caption is funny because it implies that the person on the wall is not part of the couple's shared life.\n- The humor in Caption B is more grounded in the situation depicted in the cartoon, which leads me to believe that humans found it funnier.

It is a clever comment on the hostility implied by the fact that someone outside the window is shooting at the therapist's office. \n\nBased on the humor theory of incongruity, Option B seems more likely to be funnier because it puts together elements that do not usually go together (relaxing on a sofa while being shot at).

It doesn't directly address the action in the cartoon, and therefore, may not be as humorous to most. \n\nOption B (\"I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t discuss my other patients\") plays off the element of surprise and humor in the cartoon. The statement indicates that the therapist is unfazed, and this lack of concern is humorous given the unexpected situation. \n\nThus, considering the context of the cartoon and the humor theories, the humorous connection between Option B and the cartoon is stronger and more direct than Option A. \n\nSo, the Answer is: B.", "response": "Final Answer: B", "instance_id": "4a20a7aa4d5c6a4c9449e217c3df991c"}
{"query": "In this cartoon, we can see a woman standing in front of a tree with a beehive attached to it, but the hive appears to have a man's face on it, which creates an uncanny effect since Beehives don't have human faces on them. \n\nOption A: \"Every breath you take, every move you make, I'll be watching you.\" is a reference to a popular song by \"the Police\". Sting, the Lead singer of \"the Police\", sang it in a stalker tone. This caption seems to connect well with the theme of the cartoon, as the man's face on the beehive seems to be doing the same thing, \"watching\" the woman who is standing in front of the tree as bees fly around her. So it could be a good match to the cartoon's narrative.\n\nOption B: \"Our parents won't approve; you're Jewish and I'm a Wasp.\" does not seem to connect well with the central theme of the cartoon.

{"query": "Both captions are funny in their own way, but I would say that \"B: Well, I think he's nailed the talent portion\" is the funnier caption. Here's my reasoning:\n\nCaption A is humorous because it subverts the expectation of the reader, who might expect the caveman to be doing something primitive instead of juggling torches. However, the humor in this caption is more subtle and requires the reader to think a bit more.\n\nCaption B, on the other hand, is more overtly humorous. It uses a phrase typically associated with beauty pageants (\"talent portion\") to describe the caveman's juggling act, creating a humorous juxtaposition between the two. This caption also has a surprising twist, because the reader might expect the caption to comment on the dangerousness of juggling torches, but instead it comments on the caveman's ability to perform the trick.\n\nOverall, I think that caption B is the stronger of the two because it is more immediately and obviously funny.

The contrast between such a grave and eerie figure engaging in a casual and lighthearted activity such as playing baseball is the crux of the humor here.

This could be seen as a humorous directive to the elephant model, but it is less clever than option A when it comes to interpretation. \n- The caption attempts to be funny through a subtle observation of the scene but lacks the subversive commentary of the first option.\n\nBased on these observations, \"Option A: 'I'm calling it 'The Elephant in the Room'\" would arguably be chosen as the funnier caption.

It may refer to some imaginary project mentioned by the man or woman in the cartoon, which is not clear from the image. As such, it may be more difficult for readers to understand and find humorous.\n\nBased on this analysis, the funnier option is A: \"Now you know how I felt when you showed up.\"", "response": "Final Answer: A", "instance_id": "af11c2a9abd0f03715fb1d3ea796abf2"}
{"query": "For this cartoon, we have a scenario where musicians are playing when a monster truck suddenly appears and flattens their chairs. In option A, the caption invokes a humorous mash-up of two things: the famous song 'Ride of the Valkyries', and the TV show 'Pimp My Ride', by borrowing an iconic element from each. This is clever word play with a touch of irreverence. On the other hand, option B references the topical issue of hurricanes, but it's not immediately clear how it fits with the content in the image. Overall, I think that option A is the funnier caption, as it has the more clearly humorous premise and plays on well-known cultural references.

This is an unusual sight, and it is unexpected that a tentacle is emerging from the ocean and kidnapping someone. \n\nStep 2: Analyzing Caption A - \nCaption A is a reference to a common trope in Japanese movies and anime, where a giant tentacle monster kidnaps Japanese women. This caption plays on the cultural reference and applies it in an unexpected way, creating a bit of a surprise and a chuckle. However, the joke is reliant on the reader being aware of the cultural reference, which not everyone may be.\n\nStep 3: Analyzing Caption B - \nCaption B plays on the concept of ransom and kidnapping. The speaker is wondering how he will gather the funds (in the form of shrimp) to pay the ransom for the tentacle\u2019s victim. The humor here comes from the unexpected comparison of tentacle abduction with typical kidnapping scenarios, and the absurdity of the proposed ransom payment. \n\nStep 4: Choosing the funnier caption - \nBoth captions play on unexpected scenarios, but Caption B seems to have a broader appeal that readers will relate to more easily. It has a clear setup and punchline structure and plays on a more universal concept (kidnapping and ransom). While Caption A may be funny for some, Caption B has a stronger appeal.

Instead, the therapist in this cartoon is saying that the car should come back for another session in 5,000 miles. This type of humor is more absurd and relies on the cartoon's setting to create the punchline.\n\nIn conclusion, both captions use humor related to the setting of the cartoon (the therapy session).

Caption A references money-laundering cases, which are not usually associated with dishwashing, and it implies that the judge has had too many of these cases. Caption B references the judges' robes, which are long and traditional, and suggests that the bailiff would prefer something more practical like a short-sleeved robe.\n\nBoth captions have potential for humor, but Caption A plays more with the idea of incongruity, as it connects two things that are not usually associated with each other: dishwashing and money-laundering.

The humor in this cartoon may derive from the juxtaposition of the benign picnic setting with the ominous storm cloud.

The caption uses wordplay to simultaneously evoke a sense of unpredictability (partly cloudy vs. chance of rage) and humor (typo).\n\nOption B, on the other hand, is a completely unrelated statement that does not directly relate to the cartoon. While the comment about the father may be amusing in some contexts, it is not clear how it relates to the scene, and does not offer any additional insight into the humor of the cartoon.\n\nTherefore, based on the humor and linguistic features of the two options, it seems that Option A is the funnier caption as it directly alludes to the image in the cartoon and uses clever wordplay to create a humorous effect.\n\nAnswer: A", "instance_id": "126eb48c1eec58078476cbb65a12aaf4"}

This is a common trope in comedy - someone plays dead or unconscious for some reason. It's also a darkly humorous question to ask in a morgue, where all the deceased people are, in fact, stiff. \n\nOption B: \"Damn placebo!\" is a bit less clear. A placebo is a medicine or treatment that has no actual therapeutic effect, but may make a patient believe they are receiving real treatment.

The imagery suggests that the magicians\u2019 illusions have gone awry and that the couple is staring in disbelief. \n\nNow, let's analyze the two caption options:\nOption A, \"Did I mention our medical benefits?\", seems to be a non-sequitur and does not seem to relate directly to the cartoon's elements and the situation depicted. While it is a play on the concept of \"damage control\" in a professional environment, it's a bit of a stretch to apply it to a scenario involving magicians.\n\nOn the other hand, Option B, \"It\u2019s not what it looks like,\" is a more direct and relevant caption that immediately connects with the situation at hand. This is a popular phrase to use in situations where someone is wrongly accused, and the person is trying to explain the situation to others. Given the confused expressions on the magicians' faces and the surprise look on the couple\u2019s face, it seems more appropriate in the given context.\n\nTherefore, the funnier caption is Option B, \"It\u2019s not what it looks like.\" \n\nAnswer: B", "instance_id": "ada6da9214a5be55971470630e87994e"}

The humor in caption A lies in the contrast between the rat's apparent naivet\u00e9 in thinking that strapping wings on himself would make him more desirable to humans, and the reality of the situation - that the rat is still a rat. This contrast creates a humorous dissonance between the rat's perception and the viewer's perception, which is a classic humor technique. In contrast, caption B may be funny to some, but it relies on knowledge about pharmaceutical testing to fully understand the joke, which may limit its appeal to a broader audience.

In Option B, the reference to Luca Brasi connects to the Godfather movie and is another nod to the classic mafia trope.

The humor comes from the juxtaposition of the absurdly large umbrella, which could be considered equipment, with the couple simply walking in the rain. The caption creates a humorous incongruity between the situation and the umbrella.\n\nCaption B, \"Go and check if it's still raining. I'll wait here,\" is a clever twist on a classic idiom. Instead of saying \"I'll go check if it's still raining,\" the man offers to stay under the shelter of the umbrella while his partner gets soaked. The humor here comes from the reversal of expectations, and the selfishness of the man's request.\n\nWhile both captions have some comedic value, Caption A uses the umbrella as the focal point of the humor, rather than the people and their actions.

Option A sets up an expectation with the phrase \"board meetings\" that is then twisted into the more humorous \"bored meetings\".

It takes advantage of the anthropomorphized dog to introduce a humorous reference to Lassie, the famous TV show about a heroic dog who would save Timmy after he fell down a well. It's also a clever play on the fact that the woman in the cartoon appears to be discussing something with the man, while the dog appears to be reading a book. The caption is relatively short, and it follows the classic formula of a punchline followed by a setup.\n\nOption B: \"I prefer a hard-cover book for its solidness.\" - This caption is not as humorous as option A, as it doesn't contain any misdirection or unexpected plot twist. Instead, it's a straightforward play on the fact that the dog is reading a book, and that the woman appears to be engaged in a conversation. While the caption is somewhat clever, it's not as funny as the first option.\n\nBased on the above analysis, I believe that Option A is funnier, as it contains a clear misdirection and plays off a well-known cultural reference to Lassie.

In this case, the incongruity is between the heat and a ceiling fan, both of which are unrelated to the giraffe, but after the viewer sees the giraffe persona, the connection becomes humorous.\n\nStep 4:\nTherefore, the Answer is A.", "response": "Final Answer: A", "instance_id": "a0f896cf20c838ec1dc5a3b76180e746"}

Additionally, with the rise of virtual backgrounds because of the Covid-19 pandemic, this caption might resonate with people more.\n\nCaption B: \"My story isn't nearly as dramatic.

The humor in this caption stems from the idea that the dog is willing to let go of its prized possession, the ball, in order to appease the werewolf and avoid confrontation.

Here is my step-by-step reasoning to arrive at an answer:\n\n- For caption A (\"Dr. Ogden just called to say your mercury levels are on the high side\"), the humor comes from the fact that walruses are known to have high levels of mercury due to their diet of fish and shellfish. The caption suggests that the walrus has been living in someone's house long enough to accrue abnormally high mercury levels, which is absurd and unexpected. Furthermore, the mention of a doctor adds to the impression that the walrus is a house guest who is not behaving quite right. Overall, this caption leverages the element of surprise to generate humor.\n- For caption B (\"Nobody ever expected the Little Mermaid to take out the trash\"), the humor comes from the juxtaposition of two unrelated things: a walrus reading a book, and the Little Mermaid taking out the trash. While both of these things could plausibly happen in a fantastical world, the fact that they're happening together in someone's living room is bizarre and unexpected. This caption is an example of non-sequitur humor, which can sometimes be successful if the two things don't seem to belong together. \n\nBoth of these captions take different approaches to humor, and it's difficult to definitively say which would be funnier as taste in humor varies so greatly from individual to individual. However, based on my experience with the New Yorker contest and analyzing what type of captions are typically chosen as winners, I would say that caption A (\"Dr. Ogden just called to say your mercury levels are on the high side\") is more likely to have been selected as the funnier of the two. The reason being it uses wordplay and a reference to a well-known feature about walruses to build its humor, which is the type of humor that often fares well in the contest. \n\nAnswer: A", "instance_id": "87359bec9d95950aaeee936ea901e4af"}

The humor here might be due to the absurdity of the situation, as sharks usually eat real animals for food and not mannequins.\n\nStep 2: When looking at the captions, \"I don't think it's fresh\" could be referring to the mannequin store display model not being a real animal, thus not being a fresh meal for the sharks. This caption could be funny due to the unexpected use of the phrase \"fresh\" in the context of a mannequin.\n\nOn the other hand, \"needs dressing\" might be referring to the mannequin store display not being dressed, rather than it needing actual dressing or sauce. This caption could be funny due to the wordplay involved in the double meaning of \"dressing\".\n\nStep 3: In my opinion, \"Needs dressing\" is the funnier caption as it involves wordplay and is more unexpected. The phrase \"fresh\" in \"I don't think it's fresh\" is expected in the context of a food joke, whereas \"needs dressing\" adds a layer of complexity to the joke.

It also contains a clever play on words by using \"third monkey\" instead of \"third person\" when referring to the story.\n\nStep 4: Based on this analysis, it seems that Caption B is more clever and relevant to the cartoon scene, and therefore funnier.\n\nAnswer: B", "instance_id": "ae54901bbf31dd947f5215b76bcf984e"}

The humor here comes from the juxtaposition of the mundane issue of cleaning up after a dog with the outlandish threat of a werewolf. The caption is short and sweet, but perhaps lacking in the surprise element that often characterizes winning captions.\n\nOption B: \"Kinda puts going to the vet in perspective, doesn't it?\"\nThis caption is similar to option A, but instead of referencing a specific problem with the dog, it generalizes the idea of visiting the vet. By comparing the experience of facing a werewolf with a visit to the vet, the caption creates humor through exaggeration and absurdity.

This caption sets up a classic tension between predator and prey and adds a layer of humor through its unexpected, human-like means of communication. \n\nOn the other hand, Option B, \"I recommend the trout\", seems to imply that the bear is offering the fish advice on how to jump the waterfall. This is a clever twist on the age-old idea of animals being able to talk to each other, but it may not be immediately apparent to the reader why the bear is giving this recommendation to the fish.\n\nBoth options engage the \"incongruity\" theory of humor, which involves juxtaposing two events or entities that don't typically go together in a surprising way.

The humor in this lies in the fact that the woman seems to be rather casual about finding herself in prehistoric times and encountering a caveman. Instead of reacting to the strange situation, she comments about the quality of the furniture. This type of absurdist humor is often appreciated by the New Yorker audience. \n\nCaption B is a pun on the word \"clubbing,\" which can mean going to a nightclub but also refers to a barbaric act of hitting someone with a club. This caption uses the comic premise of a language misunderstanding between two people from different times. \n\nOverall, in my opinion, Caption A is funnier and more clever, as it makes a direct reference to modern design trends within the context of prehistoric times.

The reference to the dramatic scene from Titanic adds a layer of humor to the cartoon. Additionally, the image of the shark gripping the mannequin in its mouth lends itself well to this particular reference. \n\nCaption B: \"Not as good as it looked.\"\n- This caption plays on the idea that the shark was anticipating a real meal, but ended up with a mannequin instead. The humor lies in the unexpectedness of the situation, and the contrast between what the shark likely expected and what it actually obtained. \n\nConclusion:\nBoth captions have their strengths, but caption A seems to be the stronger choice. The reference to Titanic and the image of the shark holding onto the mannequin in a dramatic fashion adds a touch of absurdity and humor to the situation.

Then we notice something unusual - there's a painting of an elephant prominently displayed on one of the walls. The combination of these two elements in the scene is unexpected and might be what adds to the humor.\n\nStep 2: Analyzing the captions: \n\nOption A doesn't directly relate to anything in the cartoon, and thus may not be particularly humorous. If it is, the humor lies in the unexpectedness of the reference to Christie Brinkley. \n\nOption B doesn't relate directly to the pianos, but it does seem to be connected to the theme of unexpectedness we noticed in Step 1, as the reference to elephants seems to have nothing to do with the scene. The wording is odd and the humor may lie in the deliberate confusion generated by the caption.\n\nStep 3: Selecting the funnier caption: \n\nGiven what we know about the unexpectedness of the elements in the cartoon, option B seems to fit that theme better than option A.

This caption uses an unexpected twist, adding a humorous element to the image. Caption B, \"You\u2019ll love the headlight exhibit in the next room, it\u2019s mesmerizing,\" plays on the stereotype that deer are attracted to headlights and follows the word \"mesmerizing\" to create an image of a museum with a headlight exhibit.

Caption B seems to be more of a surprise by a sudden unexpected twist in imagining a meeting of the Sierra Club.\n\nAfter careful analysis, my answer is: Answer: A.

Thus, caption A delivers the humor in a simple yet effective manner.\n\nOn the other hand, Caption B - \"Read quickly.

This caption works because it's a classic set-up for a punchline, where the question leads the viewer to expect a serious answer, and then delivering a humorous response.\n\nOption B, \"Look busy,\" might be funny because it's a playful take on the idea that the workers outside are most likely not doing any work, and that they should appear to be working when being observed. It's a classic reversal of expectations, where the viewer expects the board members to be the ones working, but the joke turns it around so that the workers are actually the focus.\n\nAfter considering the two options, I think Option A has a slightly more clever, unexpected punchline and is more likely to have been chosen as the winning caption.\n\nAnswer: A.", "instance_id": "8164150eba696d5c3f686ed0e92a8524"}

Typically, the New Yorker humor involves analyzing the situation shown in the cartoon and taking a humorous angle or perspective on it that is unexpected, yet plausible.\n\n3. Observing the scene in the cartoon, we can see one of the cyclists is clad in a medieval suit of armor. This is unexpected and adds humor to the situation.\n\n4. Option A connects to the medieval armor by using the concept of health insurance, implying that the person is dressed in armor not for comedic effect, but because they have no other choice and are trying to protect themselves.\n\n5. On the other hand, option B assumes that the person wearing the armor is perhaps an athlete or a part of cycling team who is using steroids to gain an advantage. This has no reference to the medieval armor and may not resonate with the audience.\n\n6. In conclusion, I believe that option A is more likely to be selected as funnier, as it connects with the visual humor in the cartoon by providing a grounded reason for the person being in armor, at the same time delivering humor with its ironic twist. \n\nAnswer: A", "instance_id": "82d9ab04b98e93c82490620373ff62f5"}

The caption \"Marco!\" is a reference to the classic pool game \"Marco Polo\" in which one player closes their eyes and calls out \"Marco!\" while the other players respond with \"Polo!\" to avoid being caught. The humor in this caption comes from the absurdity of a sea serpent, a creature vastly different from a human, participating in the game.\n\nOption B (\"Scoliosis.\") is a medical term for curvature of the spine. Although the term is somewhat unexpected in this context, it is not as immediately and universally recognizable as the game of \"Marco Polo.\" The humor in this caption might take longer to be understood, and not everyone might find it funny.\n\nTherefore, Answer: A is likely the funnier caption for this particular cartoon.", "instance_id": "2246c61501f71cf112eadaf18ca4bfb5"}

The phrase itself isn't really a joke, but rather a setup for potential humor in subsequent conversation. \n\nOption A (\"You're just pulling my leg, right?\") is a more straightforward joke. It takes advantage of the fact that the rat is standing upright and holding a clipboard, anthropomorphizing the animal in a way that is surprising and amusing. By suggesting that the turtle is \"pulling [his] leg,\" the rat is acknowledging the absurdity of the situation and the humor of the cartoon. This caption plays on the idea of literal vs. figurative language, and the fact that the rat is both a literal animal and a figurative stand-in for a human researcher.\n\nSo, my final answer is: Answer: A", "instance_id": "22e5abd1ecc25c58fc8cdf451eae1e68"}

Wilma!\n\nWhich of the 2 options (A or B) is funnier? Think step-by-step and finish your response with \"Answer: X\" where X is either A or B.", "response": "Starting with option A: \"It scrape sky\" sounds like a pidgin language that is commonly associated with cavemen. While the grammatical structure of the sentence is incorrect, the use of a caveman phrase in the context of a tall building made of sand highlights an ironic twist, which is a common feature in New Yorker cartoons. This caption also plays off the observation that, for the cavemen, a building which might not be made of sand in their everyday life is still made of sand as far as they are concerned, since the only building material they know is sand itself.\n\nOption B: \"Fred! Wilma!\" is a reference to The Flintstones, a popular animated television show from the 1960s, and both the show as well as this joke are well-known cultural icons. This reference to prehistoric characters is somewhat humorous in the context of the cavemen in the cartoon, and it thereby attempts to bring the audience to what are supposed to be cavemen-like thinking. However, the reference to Fred and Wilma from The Flintstones without any further explanation has a narrow focus and may not be as broadly appealing to everyone.\n\nCombining the above thoughts, I believe Option A is the funnier of the two captions because it not only has a connection to cavemen speech, but it uses an ironic twist to make the audience laugh. It is more universally appealing and creative than option B, which is essentially a reference to a dated animated show. Answer: A.", "instance_id": "5368090f4fb0bca8d311eeab044c5d1a"}

It does, however, provide a funny contrast to the man who is walking down the rock face, as if the compass is wrong and the man is defying its direction.\n\nOption B directly references the scene with the man walking down the cliff.

Upon reading the given captions, it is clear that the humor in both options is pretty subtle. \n\nOption A's caption, \"Speak softly and carry a big fish,\" is a modified version of the classic quote \"Speak softly and carry a big stick\" attributed to Theodore Roosevelt. Although the modified phrase is clever, it is not clear how it relates to the scene in the cartoon of two men carrying a big snake. The humor here seems to stem more from the irony of the situation, rather than from the caption itself. \n\nOption B's caption, \"How badly do we want to win?\" is more directly related to the cartoon's scene. The man with the paper seems to be offering an invoice for the snake, implying that the men have brought the snake for sale. The caption plays with the double meaning of \"win,\" which could refer to winning the sale of the snake, or perhaps to the absurdity of trying to sell such a large snake. The humor is more based on the caption itself, rather than on the situation depicted in the cartoon.\n\nTherefore, between the two options, it seems that option B's caption, \"How badly do we want to win?\" has the stronger punchline in relation to the given cartoon. \n\nAnswer: B", "instance_id": "60b8f4aea9ff9ff3a7ec1eb6267ed387"}

The caption also adds a wry twist with the reference to the bomb bay, as it conjures an image of a plane fretting about its appearance in a way that we typically associate with human characters. Moreover, the joke is unexpected, as the audience expects the pilot or controller to have a quip, before the plane reveals its body image issues.\n\nCaption B also plays off the legs-like-human motif, but it is more of a straightforward pun: the plane jokes about taking \"a quick run\", i.e., a quick jog, down to the runway.

By suggesting that the dog is like an additional (and rather annoying) sibling, the caption generates a chuckle in recognition of the familiar scenario. However, Caption A doesn't quite fully utilize the visual information in the cartoon. It only refers to the child and the fact that he is not enjoying the company of the dog, but doesn't mention the dog itself.\n\nCaption B, on the other hand, builds its humor around a more specific (and unexpected) visual detail: the dog wearing people's clothes. With this, it brings a unique twist to the scene and binds it with the non-realistic feature of the dog wearing clothes. It cleverly links the dog's ability to wear clothing and succeed in training school.

This suggests that the caption needs to contain humor that relates to either the aquarium or the divorce.\n\nStep 2: Now, looking at Option A, the humor is based on the idea of a \"pair of lobsters\" being offered as a reconciliatory gift in the divorce proceedings. This is consistent with the setting and entities in the cartoon, and it is a clever and unexpected twist on a typical reconciliation gift, making it a strong candidate for a winning caption.\n\nStep 3: Moving on to Option B, the humor is based on an entirely different idea of the couple spending \"a couple of hours in the Cool Whip vat\" to gain a new perspective on their situation. While humorous in its own right, it doesn't quite connect to the aquarium or the divorce setting, so it may not be as effective in winning the contest.\n\nBased on the above analysis, Answer: A seems to be a better candidate for the winning caption.", "instance_id": "a79f20fe1cd9838d1b77c8dddbb225ef"}

Based on my understanding of humor, I would reason the following:\n\nThe cartoon has a very absurd and unrealistic element of a waiter with a very long arm reaching in from the door. The winning caption likely evokes the absurdity of this image while also using a well-known cultural reference that many people can relate to and find funny. \n\nLooking at option A, the reference to the \"Fantastic Four\" is a humorous nod to the popular comic book and movie franchise known for its characters with superhuman abilities, which includes Mr. Fantastic, who has an elastic body. This alludes to the waiter's impossibly long arm, and the idea that even those with superpowers are not immune to economic downturns, a lighthearted but clever joke. \n\nOn the other hand, option B relies more on wordplay and is a bit more obscure. The use of the word \"eponymous\" to refer to the name of the restaurant is clever, but not immediately obvious or relatable to a wide audience, which may limit its potential for humor. \n\nTherefore, in my opinion, Answer: A is the funnier caption choice, as it takes advantage of well-known cultural references and leverages the absurdity of the cartoon's context.", "instance_id": "2507446cfd142c05f215cdc1cd36dc09"}

Both captions rely on the element of surprise and the unusual juxtaposition of war outside of the couple's home.

Caption B cleverly draws attention to the absurdity of the situation in a way that subtly pokes fun at the obliviousness of the sunbathers. It's also relatable, in that we've all had moments where we've been so wrapped up in our own little worlds that we forget to be aware of our surroundings.

Caption A appears to be unrelated to the whale and the island. It seems to imply that the speaker has just discovered something unexpected about the person they are speaking to. This caption does not directly reference the whale or the island, so it isn't clear how it is supposed to be funny in the context of the cartoon.\n\nStep 3: Examine Caption B. This caption references the fact that the beachfront property (i.e. the island) looked larger on Airbnb.com. This directly references the size discrepancy between the whale and the island, which was established in the cartoon description. Additionally, it is a play on the common experience of booking accommodations online and being disappointed by their actual size in person. \n\nStep 4: Compare the two caption choices. Caption B connects more directly with the cartoon description by referencing the size discrepancy between the whale and the island. It also has a play on words that is more humorous than the statement in Caption A. Therefore, Caption B is more likely to be the funnier of the two captions.\n\nAnswer: B", "instance_id": "181337456272a074359ed2547d1cae0c"}

While the caption does connect the can-can dancers to the context of a butcher shop, it's not as unexpected or original as Caption A.\n\nTherefore, I believe that Option A is the funnier of the two, and my final answer is \"Answer: A\".", "instance_id": "2bc1b3b6267d7de9316082d705ad2f2f"}

The ostrich effect, which is represented by the ostrich with its head buried, implies that people are avoiding unpleasant or dangerous truths by ignoring them. \n\nNext, let's analyze the two caption choices. Caption A - \"The statue of the lemmings was just too depressing\" - references the idea of lemmings following each other blindly, which ties in with the ostrich effect depicted in the cartoon. However, it might be a little hard to connect the dots between the lemmings and the bull and ostrich in the cartoon, which could make this caption less funny. \n\nOn the other hand, Caption B - \"We really need to find a new route to work\" - is a simple and straightforward reference to the fact that the road is blocked by an angry bull being pushed on a platform. This caption aligns well with the literal scene depicted in the cartoon, and it's easy to understand the humor behind it.\n\nConsidering the above analysis, the Caption B seems to be the funnier of the two, relative to the cartoon provided. \n\nTherefore, Answer: B.", "instance_id": "8e84a87ad78b3c2041cffc3a4f1a3e1b"}

It's not immediately clear what this caption is supposed to mean or why it's funny. It's possible that the humor is supposed to come from the juxtaposition of the two activities - pushing a boulder uphill and pushing a stroller.

Moreover, the reference to Fashion Week which is highly related to clothing also adds a twist to the joke. In Caption B, the incongruity is between a pig and a duck.

The situation is absurd and goes against what we normally expect, which is for the human to be in control in a situation involving a cat. \n\nCaption A: \"Kids, stay in the thimble.\" - This caption doesn't seem to directly relate to the cartoon, and it may be difficult for the viewer to make the connection between the caption and the image. While it's possible that the implication here could be that the man is sewing something small and delicate like kids' clothing, which is why he has a needle, the reference to a thimble may be unclear to some viewers. So, caption A does not seem to be the funnier option.\n\nCaption B: \"What would Martha Stewart do?\" - This caption is humorous because it's unexpected and seems out of place in the situation depicted in the cartoon. Martha Stewart is a lifestyle guru and homemaker known for her expertise in cooking, decorating and crafting, so the reference to her seems to suggest that in a similar situation, Martha Stewart would use a needle to defend herself or the cat, or perhaps she would whip up a cat-friendly craft project. The contrast between the absurdity of the cartoon and the domesticity of the Martha Stewart reference makes the caption humorous.\n\nTherefore, based on my analysis, the funnier caption is Answer: B - \"What would Martha Stewart do?\"", "instance_id": "a7f775d296ea71914ce2c75eff073e5c"}

It's unclear how this relates to the cartoon and doesn't seem as humorous as option A. \n\nSo, based on these factors, I would say that option A is the funnier caption for this cartoon. \n\nAnswer: A", "instance_id": "85e97bcab4ef25cc2cefa23cbd1e6ea5"}

It features cavemen living in caves, and a few others standing in a hole in the ground. The caveman in the front is one of the cavemen living in the cave. \n\nStep 2: Now, we need to analyze the humor in each of the caption options. \n\nCaption A: \"You're right, philosophy's a dead end. I'm changing my major.\" This caption is playing on the stereotype of philosophy as a major with no practical application in the real world. The humor of the caption is in the unexpectedness of the statement, given the caveman setting. The joke may work because it's the type of statement one wouldn't expect to hear from a caveman. \n\nCaption B: \"That's Bob Mankoff. He used to be the cartoon editor of the New Yorker.\" This caption breaks the fourth wall by referencing the then-editor of the New Yorker cartoon, Bob Mankoff. The humor in the caption is in the incongruity of the high-brow reference to the New Yorker in the caveman setting.\n\nStep 3: Of the two captions, A seems to be the funnier option, as it has a stronger connection to the setting and characters in the cartoon. The surprise of hearing a caveman talking about changing his major, and the implication that cavemen have a concept of academic majors, adds to the humor. Caption B, on the other hand, relies heavily on the audience's familiarity with the cartoon editor, and may not have the same immediate impact.\n\nAnswer: A", "instance_id": "51ad1287d16e31fae2f6be9964399911"}

Option B is a play on the phrase \"It's never over easy,\" which is a humorous reference to the difficulty of Humpty Dumpty's past experiences. In my opinion, option B is more likely to resonate with the New Yorker readers and therefore more likely to be selected as the funnier one.

However, in this case, the man has a literal weight on him instead of a figurative one. This could be seen as humorous because it subverts the audience's expectations.\n\nOption B is a misdirection, as the setup (a therapy session where the patient has a giant weight on him) leads the audience to expect a punchline related to the therapy session. However, the punchline is about erectile dysfunction, which seemingly has no relation to the rest of the cartoon.\n\nConsidering the history of New Yorker cartoons and the types of captions that are typically chosen, Option A seems to be a more likely choice.

The halo around one of the angel's heads is a religious iconography, which makes this cartoon a bit irreverent and unexpected. In terms of the captions, both are potentially humorous and could work in different ways, but have slightly different tones. Caption A plays with the expectation that the viewer is supposed to be focusing on the halo, which implies modesty and selflessness, rather than the body itself. Caption B is more direct and immediate and uses a sexual innuendo to imply excitement. Both captions have an element of egotism that plays off of the halo. \n\nWhen we consider the context and overall tone of the cartoon, the misdirection in Caption A makes it more unexpectedly humorous. Caption B is more direct and expresses a bit too much overt confidence that doesn't quite match with the tone of the cartoon.

The cartoon features a horse wearing shoes, which is a surprising and odd scenario. Option B plays off of this unexpected situation by providing the reason for the horse wearing shoes, which is because they don't need to be nailed to the horse's feet. This caption is humorous because it is the opposite of what the viewer would expect-- traditionally horseshoes are nailed to a horse's hooves. In comparison, option A doesn't seem to relate to the scenario depicted in the cartoon, and is instead a political commentary. \n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning, I would say that the funnier caption is Option B. \n\nAnswer: B.", "instance_id": "98ff2072a26f9ea0d8ef969d7beb0c45"}

However, it does not directly address the shocked expression on the man's face, and it is not entirely clear who the speaker of the caption is or what their relationship is to the man.\n\nOption B also plays on the idea that the woman with the bag might need to have goats for some purpose, but it takes the scenario one step further by suggesting that the goats are for children. This explanation adds a layer to the image and provides a backstory for the goats that the reader can imagine. Additionally, the idea that goats might be a gift for children is humorous in a slightly absurd way, as goats are not usually the type of animal one would associate with children.\n\nOverall, I think that Option B is the funnier of the two captions.

On the other hand, option B plays on the idea of having some free time while the kids are with the grandparents, hinting at the enjoyment derived from time alone without the kids. \n\nBased on the common conventions in the past New Yorker caption contests, the humor typically favored by judges tends to be of a more satirical or ironic nature, and not just based on a simple concept or idea. Given this, option A seems to be the funnier and more clever caption of the two, as it presents a humorous observation related to climate change and the negative impact it can have on daily life. \n\nAnswer: A", "instance_id": "e953db9c0fd5c0702d81cf1ccbc9d2f2"}

Here's my reasoning:\n\nCaption B plays on the phrase \"skeleton in the closet\", which is a well-known idiom. However, the phrase doesn't quite fit the situation in the cartoon. The skeleton isn't in a closet, and there's no indication that it's related to the man in the next coffin. While some people might appreciate the reference, I believe that the humor is too forced and doesn't completely makes sense in context.\n\nOn the other hand, caption A is more straightforward and fits the situation in the cartoon. It uses a well-known idiom \"people are just dying to get in here\" in a humorous way that is relevant to the cemetery setting. The caption is also clever and slightly unexpected because it reverses the usual meaning of the idiom. It's a witty play on words, and I believe the natural flow of humor makes this caption funnier than B.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is: Answer: A", "instance_id": "1eb37953255d0e9225868bcf5a42760a"}

Both options are using different humor techniques, but option A is more closely tied to the visual humor in the cartoon and emphasizes the contrast between the setting and the behavior of the person being greeted.

However, it is not as directly connected to the uncanny aspect of the image.\n\nOption B (\"This is Karl from Switlerland, he's been clicking for 50 years\") seems to be better aligned with the humor of the cartoon. The caption is a play on the stereotype of Switzerland being known for producing precision instruments and the idea of a wind-up toy \"clicking\" away at a computer for 50 years. This creates a connection between the winding of the toy and the operation of the computer, making it a more satisfying pun. \n\nOverall, I believe that Option B is the winning caption for this cartoon.\n\nAnswer: B", "instance_id": "156d6a226c4578a66ed7b2149e0ba01e"}

The use of \"decompose myself\" as a play on words is clever and adds an element of humor. It also implies that maybe the man didn't recognize his coffin-mate, initially mistaking him for someone else.\n\nOption B, \"Well, yeah, I saw your tombstone, but I thought it might be a different Ned Ryerson,\" refers to the concept of premature burial, where someone is buried before they are actually dead. The caption suggests that the man buried in the grave was mistaken for someone else, possibly someone named Ned Ryerson, so he may not actually be dead. It's also a reference to the movie \"Groundhog Day,\" when the main character continuously encounters someone named Ned Ryerson.\n\nBoth options are clever and play off different elements of the cartoon.

Option B contains a pun, where \"cooking the books\" is transformed into \"baking them in a light, flaky pastry.\" \nBased on the history of New Yorker captions, puns often do well in the caption contest.

The lack of atmosphere at a subway station is noteworthy, but the caption suggests that this is a temporary situation and that it will change soon. This implies that even though the restaurant is in a subway station, it will eventually create its own atmosphere. \n\nCaption B is amusing because it is a reference to the phrase used by the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority as part of a security campaign to encourage citizens to report suspicious activity. The caption combines this phrase with a humorous interpretation to remark on the fact that the couple is dining in a subway station. \n\nBoth captions are witty, but Caption A provides a more direct connection to the scene in the cartoon and is more general in its humor.

It also highlights the uncanny element of the man's reflection, which is a clever twist on the usual mirror scene.\n\nCaption B: This caption makes a play on words with \"Lincoln decanter\" and \"Lincoln decal\", but the humor feels more forced and predictable.

Caption A, \"Anything you want to get off your chest, Carl?\" uses a pun to play with the double meaning of the phrase \"get off your chest,\" which is often used to mean confessing or admitting something that is bothering you. The weight on the man's chest is a literal representation of this metaphorical phrase, so the pun works well. Caption B, \"The good news? You're not delusional\" uses a bit of wordplay and a twist ending.

This is amusing, but it's primarily a commentary on current social issues, rather than a clever or unexpected twist on the scene depicted in the cartoon.\n\nOption B, on the other hand, is a clever play on words that subverts the religious connotations of the characters and setting. The phrase \"Good Samaritan\" is a reference to a biblical parable, but the character is using it as a boastful claim of their own moral superiority. This juxtaposition is unexpected and generates humor by subverting our expectations.\n\nTherefore, I think the funnier caption is B.\n\nAnswer: B", "instance_id": "6b290d0bf10173ee5e8090e0721a09a3"}

The caption plays with the idea that an increase in the size of beach balls is due to inflation, however, this connection is not immediately clear and requires a bit more thought to understand, which may reduce its humor impact.\n\nTherefore, based on my analysis, the answer is: A, \"No vacancy\".", "instance_id": "50100888c3c9826b9c1f7d4907071e1d"}

The cartoon features a scene with a man tied up on top of a car, and the presence of cement shoes, suggesting involvement with the Mafia. Option A brings in a humorous twist by shifting the reader's expectation of where the cops would look for a tied-up person. Option B contains a play on words that references the man tied up on the car, but it is less directly related to the situation portrayed in the cartoon. \n\nOverall, option A seems more directly connected to the scene depicted in the cartoon and incorporates a subversion of expectations for comedic effect. Option B is a more abstract reference to the image and may be less effective in eliciting a laugh. Therefore, I would say Answer: A is the funnier of the two captions.", "instance_id": "d221678dfd8966fbaa19c939eb9b6a1d"}

Caption B seems to be more direct and succinct, which could lead to more immediate recognition of the humor by readers. Additionally, it plays on the idea that lizards aren't the most long-term employees. \n\nTherefore, I believe humans found caption B to be funnier.\n\nAnswer: B", "instance_id": "5aa008f2b394dbb9d7f3c2ba6f32c47c"}

Additionally, the caption includes an element of uncertainty with the use of \"should be,\" further adding to the humor.\n\nOption B's humor stems from the fact that the animals are not very good musicians, but can be made to sound fantastic with some digital editing, which is somewhat ironic given that the animals aren't even playing their instruments. The humor in this caption comes mostly from the irony of trying to make the unimpressive sound impressive.\n\nAfter analyzing both options, I believe Option A is funnier because it has a more straightforward punchline and cleverly leverages the unexpectedness of an animal album production to set up the joke. \n\nAnswer: A", "instance_id": "551bf94b68c97d2a07d2b85f785fa927"}
