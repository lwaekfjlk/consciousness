The absurdity of the situation (people nonchalantly carrying a bomb into a house) and the play on the acronym is what makes the caption humorous.\n\nExplanation: The caption plays on the acronym \"B.Y.O.B.\" to imply that the man was unaware of the explosive nature of his neighbors' arrival, making light of the absurd situation depicted in the cartoon.", "instance_id": "34d8db4f437733a1e24c062c53a97cec"}

The humor lies in how the color of the couch and its positioning in the cartoon can visually suggest something beyond its furniture function.\n\nExplanation: The joke in the caption lies in how the color-red of the couch is used as a visual double-entendre.

Since the lizard is the only creature of its kind who can create such artwork, once it is extinct, its paintings will be more valuable. \n\nExplanation: The caption is amusing because it takes a dark turn on the otherwise light-hearted scene by suggesting that the creature who is contributing such beautiful works of art will cease to exist.

In finance, a \"pyramid scheme\" is an illegal investment scam where profits come primarily from recruiting new members into the scheme, rather than selling products. \n\nStep 3: In the context of the New Yorker cartoon, the term \"pyramid scheme\" is a humorous reference to the fact that the vendor is selling products on top of a pyramid, thus creating a literal pyramid scheme. \n\nExplanation: The caption cleverly plays on the double meaning of \"pyramid scheme\" to make a joke about the vendor selling hot dogs on top of a pyramid, which is an unusual and unexpected location for a food cart.", "instance_id": "aacdb06ec84d00d1de333c68f033b169"}

However, putting the caption and scene together, the implied joke is that the person under the chair is actually a dog named Kevin who is prone to biting when anxious or scared, and the man is calling his mom to request that she tell Kevin to stop biting him.\n\nExplanation: The joke plays on the unexpected subversion of expectations, initially setting up a tense scene with an unknown cause before revealing the comedic twist that the \"hider\" is actually a dog named Kevin. The cartoon plays off the popular sentiment that pets can act similarly to young children, and the humorous disconnect between an animal behaving like a human child in an office setting provides the humor.", "instance_id": "acfc8920730e9b4d1ff7e1294e7f8834"}

First of all, we have a man who is shoveling snow in his front yard, which is a clear indication of work. In contrast, the woman standing behind him is playing the guitar, which is a leisure activity. This contrast creates a sense of tension in the image, and the man appears to be annoyed by the woman's behavior. However, the caption takes us in a whole other direction by implying that the woman was not expecting any help from the man, but rather looking for someone to accompany her and create music together. The contrast between the man's annoyance and the woman's easygoing nature is thus flipped on its head, making the viewer laugh.\n\nExplanation: The man appears to be annoyed by the woman's leisurely behavior in the snow, but the caption reveals that the woman was not looking for help, but rather for a musical collaborator.

This is a play on the common adage \"everything in moderation,\" implying that even something as harmful as kryptonite can be beneficial if used in small quantities.\n\nStep 3: By relating the idea of kryptonite being good for you to Superman, the caption creates a humorous contrast between the superhero, who is viewed as invincible and immune to harm, and the harmful mineral that can hurt him. The twist of kryptonite being beneficial in small amounts adds another layer of humor to the joke.\n\nExplanation: The joke is based on the well-known fact that kryptonite is harmful to Superman.

The humor of the joke comes from the unexpected use of the common metaphor of \"painting oneself into a corner\" in the context of a woman digging a hole in a therapist's office.\n\nExplanation: The caption uses the unexpected metaphor of \"painting oneself into a corner\" to address an odd behavior in therapy.

FEMA is a government agency that responds to natural disasters, and their mention prompts the viewer to think that perhaps an earthquake caused the floating. However, the caption reveals that there haven't been any reports of earthquakes, suggesting an absurd explanation for the floating. \n\nExplanation: The winning caption plays with the viewer's expectations by introducing a plausible theory for the cause of the floating, only to subvert it with an absurd punchline.", "instance_id": "d130898cd331d802cb1586bbd8250753"}

The bartender's response to their question is unexpected, and draws a contrast between the human emotions we might attribute to bar-goers and the objective, mechanical world of trains.", "instance_id": "ec5e40d4da9df6ad15edb008fafdc438"}

The caption is a humorous attempt to connect two worlds that seem drastically different from each other, and generates a comical incongruity. \n\nExplanation: The caption uses the unexpected setting of an opera as a comic device to create an element of surprise while also subverting our expectations. It plays off the audience's general idea of what an opera should be like, and uses that as a humorous contrast to the Viking-themed wedding.", "instance_id": "68db3d35e95c6a7e2b8ed54ee86b2089"}

As it is not common to see a naked passenger on an airplane, there is a sense of absurdity involved.\n\nStep 2: The caption reads \"I only bring clothes that I definitely need.\" This implies that the passenger intentionally came on board with not enough clothes or perhaps without clothes, and as a result, he has resorted to traveling naked.\n\nStep 3: The statement is a play on words, where \"definitely need\" is interpreted by the nude/naked passenger in a literal, minimalist sense of attire- only wearing the absolute essential clothing. It's a humorous take that pokes fun at the man's overt nudity, while simultaneously rationalizing it in a clever and witty way.\n\nExplanation: The humorous effect comes from the contrast between the socially unacceptable situation of nakedness in a public place, and the nonchalant explanation of the nude passenger as if it were a simple decision of minimalism. The juxtaposition of the two completely different ideas with a punchline that is both unexpected and funny that evokes a burst of laughter from the reader.", "instance_id": "b88d0290d413d220c483f9fae79870dd"}

The Sphinx represents an ancient artifact that has stood the test of time, and by incorporating it into a contemporary office setting, the cartoon creates a humorous contrast between the past and the present. The question is also amusing because it is a typical question asked in job interviews, but in this context, it is absurd because the Sphinx is not capable of answering.", "instance_id": "769a9d28626f1fd370f5c1578a2e2fd5"}

This implies that the man is trying too hard to be original and make a good impression, but his idea of a first date is way too outlandish. \n\nExplanation: The caption plays with the idea of the man wearing a paper bag for their first date, implying the man is trying too hard to be original on their first meeting.

People often perceive the peacock's plumage as an ornamental show of pride to attract a mate, but the caption instead envisions the feathers being used for an everyday practical purpose, which is unexpected and humorous. \n\nExplanation: The caption plays on the idea that the peacock's plumage is typically used in mating displays.

This is humorous because killer whales are usually associated with acts of aggression and violence, and also because it's absurd to imagine a killer whale actually standing trial in a courtroom.\n\nExplanation: The caption is funny because it plays with the idea of a killer whale standing trial, which is inherently absurd. The use of legal language like \"objection\" adds to the humor by creating a contrast between the serious setting of a courtroom and the ludicrousness of the situation. The caption is also funny because it suggests that the killer whale might not actually be a killer whale, which is a play on the fact that people sometimes get accused of things they didn't actually do. Overall, the caption is a clever and humorous way to play with the conventions of the cartoon and create a surprising and amusing twist.", "instance_id": "ad8416d0ad37088d007058217307ded5"}

This is unusual for a pig, and also emphasizes the connection to the Three Little Pigs story.\n\nStep 3: The fact that the pig is at a complaint department window suggests that the pig has suffered some injury or inconvenience, and is seeking compensation or redress from the receptionist. It is unclear from the image what the complaint might be about, but the caption offers a humorous explanation that involves the pig's hairy chin getting caught in an escalator. \n\nExplanation: The joke relies on the audience's familiarity with the story of \"The Three Little Pigs\" and the pig's phrasing of \"Not by the hairs on my chinny chin chin.\" The humorous twist is that in this scenario, the pig actually does have hairs on its chin, which then become entangled in an escalator, leading to an absurd and unexpected situation.", "instance_id": "10c6ca7868ff7fb6c6101d9acee58900"}

Essentially, the joke is based on the contrast between the uncomfortable and abnormal situation in the cartoon and the humorous notion that their marital issues are the cause of it.\n  \nExplanation: The winning caption cleverly plays off the absurdity of a stuck chair on the wall in a counseling office, using it as a metaphor for an uncomfortable situation between a divorcing couple.

Typically, hunters dress in camouflage or other dark, earthy tones to blend in with their surroundings and not be seen by their prey. However, in this scenario, the hunter is hunting a TV moose, which is not going to be shot regardless of his attire. \n\nStep 3: The humor of the caption comes from the unexpected nature of the scenario and the twist on the common hunting practice of wearing dark-colored clothing.

They are simply letting him do his thing. The humor lies in the juxtaposition of modern-day grilling with the caveman setting. \n\nExplanation: The caption humorously pokes fun at the anachronism of a caveman using a grill to cook meat, while also referencing a common phrase used in everyday life.

The patient is sitting in an easy chair, and behind him there is a black bed with a chalk outline in it. \nStep 2: The caption, \"Have you always felt like a victim?\" is humorous because the chalk outline typically represents a victim of a crime, and the psychiatrist is questioning if the patient has always felt like a victim, which could be interpreted as either victimhood mentality or perhaps even that the patient is responsible for the death that the chalk outline represents. \nStep 3: Explanation: The caption plays off the dark humor of the chalk outline, suggesting a deeper meaning behind the patient's presence in the psychiatrist's office. By framing it as a question from the psychiatrist, the caption draws the viewer into the joke, inviting them to think more deeply about the cartoon's imagery.", "instance_id": "d8eb69c257a63bd6bd0d387ba1aa1888"}

Additionally, the use of the phrase \"good china\" suggests that the women are trying to compensate for the awkwardness of the situation by putting on airs and being overly formal.\n\nExplanation: The caption relies on the idea of using formal etiquette as a way of compensating for an awkward or potentially embarrassing situation.

However, in this context, the lumberjack has literally entered someone's private space without knocking. The phrase takes on a new meaning when applied to this cartoon. Therefore, the humor lies in the clever play on the standard phrase, and the irony of the situation. \n\nExplanation: The humor of this cartoon comes from the play on words in the caption, which twists the phrase \"knock before you enter\" in a context where someone was actually (and literally) stuck inside a tree because the lumberjack didn't knock before cutting it down.", "instance_id": "5951d1bcf46418213d0a063623e829af"}

The reference can be interpreted as a metaphor for understanding and communication in marriage.\n\nExplanation: The winning caption plays on the contrast between the modern technology of a digital tablet, and the antiquity of tablets made of stone, drawing attention to differences in user experience.

The judge says something to the witness, who is wearing old-fashioned clothing like a top hat.\n\nNow, let's look at the caption - \"When was the last time you saw either half of her?\" At first, this seems like an odd thing for the judge to say in a legal context. However, it is likely a reference to the outdated fashion of the witness, which could imply that they are from a different time period. The joke is that the witness is so old-fashioned that they might be from a time when people wore top hats, and the judge is essentially asking when the last time was that the witness saw a woman wearing \"modern\" clothing. The phrase \"either half of her\" is likely a play on words, implying that the witness is so old-fashioned that they might not be aware of modern fashion trends, with a side of tongue-in-cheek humor. \n\nExplanation: The judge's question makes no sense in a legal context, but it is a humorous jab at the witness's outdated fashion and potential historical background, which the judge is trying to highlight in a clever way.", "instance_id": "32d34ac61815406abfe6ac3f478f8868"}

It is a witty way to apply this concept to the dogs and the Elizabethan collars they are wearing.\n\nExplanation: The winning caption is amusing because it uses a common phrase (I could never pull that off) in an unexpected and humorous way, by applying it to the conical collars that are meant to prevent the dogs from scratching.

The caption pokes fun at the current trend of showcasing food on social media, which has gotten so competitive that even a pizza can attract the attention of the paparazzi.\n\nExplanation: The caption highlights the current trend of food photography on social media, where people compete to take the best pictures of their food. The humor derives from the fact that the paparazzi are more interested in photographing a pizza than the people in the high-end restaurant. The caption makes a humorous commentary on the absurdity of the situation, suggesting that it's comical that the paparazzi have become so obsessed with capturing the perfect food photo that they now chase after pizzas in fancy restaurants.", "instance_id": "e3820b73eeee951c8a95be79a979a4c3"}

The humor lies in the fact that the mice, as smart and well-dressed as they are, can't actually request grant money or do significant scientific research.\n\nExplanation: The joke in this cartoon is that the mice are extremely intelligent and capable. They are dressed in lab coats and carrying clipboards, just like real-life scientists.

The caption is mocking the sudden newfound sophistication of the human race and their impact on the mammoth's extinction.\n\nExplanation: The winning caption emphasizes the realization that the discovery of fire by early humans was a game changer in their ability to effectively hunt animals like woolly mammoths, ultimately leading to their extinction. The caption is a play on the idea that the mammoth was initially unbothered by humans until they discovered fire.

So, in this case, the knight and executioner are carrying out the execution, but the patient doesn't need anesthesia because the \"blade\" is a boxing glove.\n\nExplanation: The caption is amusing because the speaker, who is supposed to provide anesthesia, wrongly assumes that the person about to be executed needs anesthesia.

The cartoon depicts a caveman and a mammoth working together to create a cave painting of an elephant, which is humorous because it presents a hypothetical situation that could not have occurred in real life.\n2. The winning caption adds another layer of humor to the situation by comparing the caveman's artwork to a symbol of a political party in the present day, implying that even the most primitive political parties are not as primitive as the caveman's art. \n3. The contrast between the prehistoric scene and modern-day politics is what makes the caption humorous.\n\nExplanation: The humor in the cartoon comes from the absurdity of a caveman and a mammoth creating a painting of an elephant, but the winning caption adds to the humor by making a comparison between the primitive artwork and modern-day politics, highlighting the irony that even though the caveman is supposed to represent a primitive time, some political parties today can be equally primitive.", "instance_id": "58734f98b4ed530e8aa348f63133ebfc"}

The caption reads \"Does he know why we invited him to the barbecue?\" This caption is humorous because it implies that the bull thinks he's attending a pool party/barbecue, when in reality he is the main course for the barbecue. It's humorous because this statement is a reversal of the typical expectation: usually the bull would be a guest at a barbecue, while the humans are the ones doing the grilling.\n\nExplanation: The caption is funny because it creates a reversal of expectation, making the bull the unsuspecting guest of the party rather than the main course. It's a clever play on words, as the statement is both a question of the bull's intentions and a statement about what's about to happen to him. It subverts the reader's expectations and takes the traditional idea of \"inviting someone to a barbecue\" to a humorous new level.", "instance_id": "9d0227fecd224d38c59c6a427af69810"}

The pun is that generally \"uncoupling\" refers to the process of separating two parts of a train's cars, but here is used to indicate the train's divorce with its partner.\n\nExplanation: The joke is a play on the double meaning of \"uncoupled.\" While trains usually uncouple mechanically, this caption implies that the locomotive here has split from its partner, becoming a \"train on the rocks.\"", "instance_id": "31fe9f541b364a237d3af4626fd820a9"}

But in the current economy, the man might not be able to afford to go on multiple vacations, so he has to get creative.\n\nExplanation: The man in the cartoon has combined all of his vacation activities into one trip, and the caption adds a humorous element by suggesting that this approach is a necessary adaptation to the current economic climate.", "instance_id": "891fa18253fe23c6f4afa01c3ba52199"}

The phrase \"Your sins are forgiven\" is something that a priest might say during a confession.

The humor in the caption arises from the suggestion that the couple has been experiencing other bizarre events and occurrences, such as seeing an elephant or strange creatures, and that the appearance of the giraffe is yet another strange event to be discussed or rationalized. \n\nExplanation: The humor in this cartoon arises from the unexpected appearance of a giraffe in a living room and the absurdity of the caption that suggests the occurrence of other strange events that need to be discussed. The humor comes from the reader's ability to identify with a more relatable situation, but in the context of the cartoon the situation is entirely surreal and unexpected.", "instance_id": "eb15445bdabab37f110d3d6e7d1bc89d"}

This juxtaposition creates an unexpected effect, which makes it a humorous and unique image.   \nStep 3: The winning caption adds to the humor of the cartoon by suggesting that the man's life is now so short that he needs to party as much as possible before he dies. This communicates the man's defiance and his desire to live life to the fullest, even if it means indulging in a beer through an IV. \n\nExplanation: The caption highlights the absurdity of the situation by turning it into a joke. It does this by playing off the common cultural trope of living out the remainder of one's days with wild abandon, thus subverting the seriousness of the situation and adding an element of humor.", "instance_id": "6d877f67179eff6a87a9aabf66505cbf"}

Essentially, the contrast between the absurdity of a man popping out of a cake and the banality of a credit card issue creates a humorous tension.\n\nExplanation: The caption plays on the surprise element of the man's appearance from the cake, but instead of providing an expected humorous or celebratory comment, it instead turns to the mundane as a way to undercut the anticipation and humor.", "instance_id": "33931a9f15fe66b1cb465dd2c17fea2b"}

Given the context of the cartoon, the humor arises from the fact that the man is already dead and therefore the IV drip is pointless, but the humor is also a dark commentary on how the man's passing makes the IV drip seem irrelevant.\n\nExplanation: The joke is about the absurdity of the situation, that even though the dead man is already gone, his IV drip is still going. The caption \"We'll eventually miss him.\" implies that the man isn't gone yet and still being treated with IV, but he actually is gone, which causes the humor.

The word \"troupe\" evokes the idea of a group of performers who are all dressed up in costume, which fits perfectly with the idea of the dinosaur skeleton being dressed up.\n\nStep 3: The joke lies in the unexpected comparison being drawn between the dinosaur skeleton and a troupe of dancers.

Three of them have tied up the fourth man, and have apparently placed his feet into buckets.\n- The most obvious interpretation of this cartoon is that the three men have kidnapped the fourth man, and are preparing to do something nefarious to him. The fact that his feet are in buckets suggests that they might be planning to weigh him down and drop him into a body of water.\n- The caption is a wry comment on the situation. Rather than expressing shock or outrage at the kidnapping, the speaker treats it as a matter-of-fact occurrence. Moreover, the speaker suggests that the sloppy way in which the kidnappers have tied up their victim is unprofessional, and gives the \"mob\" a bad name.\n- The humor of the caption lies in the way it undercuts the seriousness of the situation depicted in the cartoon. Rather than being horrified by the kidnapping, the speaker is more concerned with the shoddy execution of the crime. This creates a sense of absurdity and incongruity that is characteristic of New Yorker humor.\n\nExplanation: The caption makes light of a serious situation by treating it in a matter-of-fact way and focusing on a trivial aspect of the crime.

The word \"gnarly\" is slang for something that is extreme or exciting, typically used in the context of extreme sports like surfing.\n\nExplanation:\nThe humor in this caption comes from the juxtaposition of the two worlds - the professional world of an office and the free-spirited world of surfing.

The caption adds to the humor by suggesting that the man's surfing adventure was more exciting than his upcoming meeting.

However, the humor comes from the fact that the man is already employed and apparently didn't realize this. \n\nExplanation: The caption implies that the man had to wait in line for job interview, but the humor comes from the fact that he is already employed but didn't realize he was the employer's first choice.", "instance_id": "3dccd9129a221e8c06b0f3d264abe74a"}

The unconventional use of fishing rods in the bedroom is compared to the unconventional use of a pick-up line to lure someone in.

The phrase \"we wait forever, then two come at the same time\" is often used to complain about the absence of something followed by an overabundance of it. However, in the context of this cartoon, it is a play on words in which the subway cars, which are typically associated with crowded conditions and long waits, appear in the middle of nowhere. The humor derives from the contrast between the remote location of the subway cars and the frustrated expectation that they were hoping to catch a train. \n\nExplanation: The caption uses a well-known frustration we all have with subways - which is waiting for a long time for a train that never seems to arrive. But when the explorers encounter two subway cars in the middle of the woods, the caption adds a clever twist to the common expression, making fun of the frustration-cum-disappointment of never seeing a single train to suddenly seeing multiple trains at once, when least expecting them.", "instance_id": "fd67812bf1b6ab1a9ea824699b608674"}

Thus, the knight's frustration at having to pose for a picture instead of fighting to the death comes as a surprise. \n\nExplanation: The caption creates humor by unexpectedly revealing the dragon is holding a camera, not a weapon, leading to the knight's frustration at not being able to fight the dragon.", "instance_id": "2f0bbfca4ba3df2d0610bf91ea76aeea"}

The caption, \"Relax, she prefers dachshunds,\" is implying that the empty leash is meant for a dachshund (a specific breed of dog), and the woman in question doesn't want any other kind of dog. This also explains why the man without a dog seems so calm about it. The joke is that the situation is completely normal for this particular individual, as he is aware of the woman's preference for dachshunds, and that's why he doesn't have a dog attached to his leash. The absurdity of the situation adds to the humor.\n\nExplanation: The joke is that the man without the dog leash in the cartoon is relaxed because the woman he is walking with has a preference for dachshunds, thus his empty leash is for that breed, and he doesn't need to worry about having a different dog.", "instance_id": "134909964a0e80afd49abde08942fc6c"}

This introduces a sense of irony.\n- The caption, \"Honey? The baby's outsmarted me again,\" adds to the ironic situation by suggesting that the man is being outsmarted by a baby, even though he is an adult who needs containment.\n\nExplanation: The humor in this cartoon comes from the reversal of expected roles between a baby and an adult.

The idea of cooking a briefcase on a grill is ridiculous, as briefcases are not meant to be cooked or eaten.

It seems as though the woman is casually acquiring men as one might acquire groceries for the week. However, the wordplay is on the surprised visual of the woman carrying a man effortlessly with one arm, leading to a punchline that is unexpected in this context.\n\nExplanation: The caption is using a double entendre, which plays on the visual irony of the cartoon. It appears that the woman has easily picked up a man along with her suitcase. However, in reality, she is physically unable to carry a man in such an easy manner due to his weight, which creates humorous juxtaposition.", "instance_id": "f127457403cf4d3c13630ad45ad0410c"}

However, it can also refer to the stiffness one can experience after sitting at a desk for a long period of time.\n- The caption also acts as a subtle nod to the setting of the cartoon, as the question of \"stiffness\" could refer to either the body lying in the coffin or the man sitting at the desk.\n\nExplanation: The winning caption used a play on words to create a lighthearted and humorous connection between the two characters in the cartoon. By using the term \"stiffness\", the caption cleverly refers to both the rigid nature of the body in the coffin and the potential physical discomfort of sitting at a desk for an extended period of time, making for a clever and amusing joke.", "instance_id": "f6d2cf6e5ef941b4a24c37ed5a6513b5"}

He has been sent by the Marketing department to modernize death, which has traditionally been associated with grim reapers. The caption is funny because it is a clever twist on the concept of grim reapers and their traditional image, and because it makes light of the idea that even death can be subject to modernization and branding.\n\nExplanation: The winning caption is funny because it is a clever twist on the traditional image of grim reapers and because it pokes fun at the idea of modernizing and branding even the concept of death.", "instance_id": "3bd6493cd94376c697cd82e8f5ba6f4f"}

The humor in this caption comes from the absurdity of giving directions in this complex way, as it wouldn't make sense to a human, but would make perfect sense to a mouse. \n\nExplanation: The caption parodies the way lab mice are often subjected to complicated mazes in experiments, and the humor comes from the ridiculousness of giving a mouse-headed scientist directions as if they were navigating a labyrinth in order to reach the cafeteria. It's a clever and amusing way to riff on the theme of scientific experimentation while also satirizing the way we think about how creatures make sense of their surroundings.", "instance_id": "2df328dfcc0efaa674c0de73a7a5b277"}

In this case, the caveman in the suit is jokingly implying that his modern appearance will be worth more to future generations once he is no longer alive to experience it. \n\nExplanation: The joke is a playful reference to the trend of artists, writers, and musicians becoming more famous and their work becoming more valuable after their death.

The caption mentions that this lifeguard is active only during high tide.\n\nStep 2: \"High tide\" refers to a moment during the day where the sea level is the highest, and waves are more powerful than usual. The caption is punning on this phrase, using it to refer to the height of the lifeguard tower. \n\nStep 3: The joke is that the lifeguard tower is so tall that it would only be useful \u2013 or visible \u2013 during high tide when the sea level is higher than usual. Otherwise, during low tide, the lifeguard would not be able to see anything from that height. The caption takes \"high tide\" out of its original meaning and repurposes it to describe the height of the lifeguard chair, resulting in a playful and unexpected twist. \n\nExplanation: The caption plays on the double meanings of \"high tide\" to describe the tower's extreme height and the moment when the lifeguard would be useful.

He is a businessperson who is interested in profiting from any water that the nomad might find. The statement adds a humorous twist to the situation, given the dire state of the nomad.\n\nStep 3: Overall, the joke comes from the absurdity of the businessperson's lack of empathy for the nomad's plight. Rather than being concerned about the nomad's immediate needs, he is instead focused on his own interests. The caption highlights the harsh realities of capitalism and corporate greed in a humorous and ironic way.\n\nExplanation: The joke is based on the unexpected behavior of the businessperson in the cartoon.

The caption is funny because it takes a trend that many people have accepted as normal (using a standing desk) and compares it to another strange behavior (confronting someone while wearing a bed) to create a humorous juxtaposition.\n\nExplanation: The caption compares the oddness of confronting someone while still in bed to the oddness of using a standing desk, poking fun at office trends and the lengths that people will go to increase productivity or efficiency.", "instance_id": "b194f95cf319fe362ec6b15f127d9214"}

This implies that the sandwich is a result of poor transportation management.

Since the joke is about the danger of the predators in the Serengeti to humans, the caption sardonically refers to the lion becoming an internist by default from consuming the doctor and his tools.\n\nExplanation: The caption implies that one of the lions in the field just ate a doctor, and therefore became an \"internist\" \u2013 a kind of doctor who specializes in internal medical problems.

By saying \"his later jumps,\" the caption suggests that this group of dancers will not actually survive their \"jump\" from the plane. \n\nExplanation: The caption takes advantage of the viewer's initial expectation that all the skydivers are supposed to jump out with parachutes.

Hacking (breaking into a computer system) is generally seen as a digital act of aggression, not a physical one with swords. The caption adds a layer of unexpected humor to the image by providing a clever and surprising explanation for what could be a violent or aggressive scenario.\n\nExplanation: The caption subverts our expectations by using a common phrase associated with digital security breaches to describe a physical attack with a sword, creating an unexpected twist in the image and making the viewer laugh.", "instance_id": "4d12860f3dc3829092d2d95266a37a86"}

The caption suggests that the woman might be questioning her partner (Henry) over his fidelity amidst such an unusual situation, and implies that the woman is possibly prioritizing her relationship over her immediate safety. \n\nExplanation: The caption plays on the idea that the woman is seemingly calm in the face of what could be a dangerous situation (burglary) while her dog looks on. It also adds an unexpected, random element to the situation by mentioning the woman's distrust of Henry, which puts his honesty into question.

The humor comes from the stark contrast between the man's perceived fear and his actual concern about something mundane like showing off his new shoes.\n\nExplanation: The caption \"Yes, they're new shoes, but it's no one you know\" provides a humorous twist to the cartoon by revealing that the man's anger towards the alligator is actually due to his concern about showing off his new shoes to someone he doesn't know.

The passenger's demand for the caveman to \"invent a job\" is jarring because it assumes a level of expertise and opportunity that is clearly not present in his historical situation.\n\nStep 3: The caption suggests that the caveman is being transported to an employment agency, where he will hopefully find a job despite being from a completely different time. The incongruity of the situation is what makes the joke funny.\n\nExplanation: The humor in this cartoon comes from the stark contrast between the primitive world of the caveman and the modern world of the passenger in the limousine, as well as the expectation that the caveman can simply \"invent a job\" despite being from an entirely different time period.", "instance_id": "c3ae9f4f85c7169f38d166fb5f6ad4a9"}

The caption has the word \"nest egg\", which is a term used to refer to retirement savings. The word \"Ponzi\" is a reference to a financial scam, where returns are paid to earlier investors with the capital contributed by newer investors.\n4. Putting together the above observations, it appears that the caption is suggesting that the farmers were actually investors who ended up losing their retirement savings to a Ponzi scheme, led by the executive. This interpretation is further corroborated by the reference to the \"varmint\", which comes across as a mix of accusatory and colloquial in tone.\n\nExplanation: The caption is playing on the dual meaning of \"nest egg\" as retirement savings and as a treasure that needs to be protected. By referring to the executive as a \"Ponzi varmint\" and asking if he is the one who lost their retirement savings, the farmers are implying that their savings were lost to a fraudulent scheme led by the executive.

So, the caption is simultaneously commenting on the man's literal \"hand\" in controlling the puppet, and his figurative \"hand\" in being responsible for the situation being discussed in the office. The play on words highlights the absurdity of a grown man holding a puppet in the context of a business office.\n\nExplanation: The winning caption \"Of course he had a hand in this!\" uses wordplay to comment on the literal and metaphorical \"hand\" of the man holding the puppet in the office, adding humor to the absurdity of the situation.", "instance_id": "a658ba959dec20c7d13d729da4721cdc"}

This is a humorous take on the idea that the law can be complex, and that people can be unaware of some of its requirements.\n\nExplanation: The caption plays with the stereotype that the law is dense and obscure, and thus requires a broad knowledge and understanding.

The humor lies in the irony of the situation, as the workers are in a dangerous situation that does not require any assistance from the grim reaper.\n\nExplanation: The winning caption is funny because it plays with the audience's expectations regarding death, as the workers are already in a risky situation without the help of the grim reaper.

The suspect, not understanding that the clown is not a real officer, would fear being squeezed into the car and potentially harmed.\n\nExplanation: The humor in this caption comes from the unexpected appearance of a clown in an interrogation room, playing on the idea that the clown may be an actual police officer.

The contrast between what one expects to find in a suitcase (clothes) and what's actually inside (fish and water) adds to the absurdity of the situation.\n\nExplanation: The caption plays on the common experience of not knowing what to pack for a trip, but takes it to an extreme by suggesting that the person is so indecisive that they bring an aquarium instead of clothes.

This play on words and unexpected turn contributes to the humor of the caption.\n\nExplanation: The caption is a clever play on words about settings for a toaster and settings for a genie lamp.

The humorous twist highlights how something ordinary can take on new, significant meaning in a different context.\n\nExplanation: The caption humorously juxtaposes the mundane act of paper shredding with the contentious issue of ballot counting in the 2020 election, revealing how even the most commonplace actions can suddenly become highly salient in a new context.", "instance_id": "ba961174bc33c66f2289ca7b97f83041"}

The humor arises from the contrast between the expected macho bravado of a bull-man in a bar and the unexpected domesticity implied by the reference to a spousal leash. \n\nExplanation: The caption plays on the idea that the bull-man should be confident and powerful due to his bullistic features, but instead he is depicted as subservient to his controlling wife, who he fears having to answer to.

However, if we read the cartoon carefully, we notice that all of the naked people are actually sitting on chairs that have tags with numbers on them. It is as if they are possessions that are being audited, rather than people who have chosen to be naked. \n\nStep 2: The joke seems to be that the stockholders are treating these naked people as if they are mere assets rather than human beings, and that the audit is a serious matter to ensure that these assets are accounted for. The speaker seems to take this process as very normal and expects that the naked people will just be returned once the audit is done. This juxtaposition of a situation that is clearly bizarre (a group of naked people at a stockholders' meeting) with the deadpan tone of the speaker creates a humorous and ironic scenario. \n\nExplanation: The joke is about the dehumanization of individuals by powerful institutions, and how the people at the stockholders meeting have lost sight of the humanity of the naked people. The humor comes from the absurdity of the situation (a group of naked people being audited) contrasted with the matter-of-fact tone of the speaker who seems to take this situation as perfectly normal.", "instance_id": "adc7704584e2014ecd90e066f6e687f3"}

This is further underscored by the physical restraint of the man in stocks, resulting in a clever play on words that combines both interpretations of the phrase.\n\nExplanation: The winning caption \"It was a very hostile takeover\" is a pun that combines the traditional meaning of the phrase, which is an aggressive corporate takeover, with the physical restraint depicted in the cartoon.

This humorous take on the phrase \"half empty/half full\" shows the power of positive thinking, even in a situation that appears to be depressing or gloomy.\n\nExplanation: The caption takes a positive spin on the fact that only the man's side of the bed is wet, implying that an optimist always sees the glass as half full, even in a situation that seems depressing.", "instance_id": "144f6e86194c4d89bfa67247f8995124"}

The joke is based on the idea that even though the modern woman is in a prehistoric setting, her mannerisms (using a coffee table) are still present. The suggestion to use a coaster is a classic example of civilized manners, which adds to the absurdity of the situation.\n\nExplanation: The joke in the cartoon lies in the contrast between the prehistoric setting and the modern coffee table and, by extension, the mannerisms of the modern woman.

Additionally, the caption draws a clever parallel between food and alien life forms, using the idea that aliens could be \"carb-based\" organisms. \n\nExplanation: The caption for this cartoon is funny because it points out the common stereotype that aliens look a certain way, while also using a clever parallel between food and life forms to humorously suggest another way of thinking about extraterrestrial biology.", "instance_id": "d213281c3d296ca197326fcb8c9c608a"}

The caption, \"I have to warn you, I don't exactly have a bladder of steel,\" seems unrelated, but is humorous because it is unexpected. The caption is funny because it adds a random, unexpected comment to the situation, and contrasts with the gravity and seriousness of Superman's character.\n\nExplanation: The humor in this caption derives from its unexpected and random addition to the context of the cartoon.

The caption states, \"I'm sorry.

The flowers held by the dragon can be seen as a peace offering, but the caption implies that the dragon has had bad experiences in the past and is wary of being hurt again. This creates a playful twist on the trope of the savage dragon and the helpless princess.\n\nExplanation:\nThe joke relies on a humorous play on the stereotype of a dragon, with the creature defying the usual depictions of dragons in media as dangerous and intimidating. Instead, the dragon in the cartoon is portrayed as friendly and holding a bouquet of flowers. The caption adds further depth to this characterization, suggesting that maybe the dragon has made attempts at peaceful interaction before, only to be burned (i.e. hurt) by humans.

The suggestion that the pinwheel hat-wearing dino might be a toy is reinforced by the fact that the hat is the only colored-in element of the cartoon.

Salt is known to be harmful to snails, so the caption uses this knowledge to make light of a dire situation. Essentially, the caption is a play on the common idiom \"you reap what you sow\", suggesting that the giant snail is an outcome of not dealing with smaller snails in a timely manner.\n\nExplanation: The caption cleverly connects the unusual scenario of a giant snail with a common and mundane method of dealing with regular snails, creating a humorous and unexpected contrast. It also suggests a criticism of the inactivity or inaction towards a minor issue, which has now led to an extreme situation.", "instance_id": "ef853c0dd892dd48d39a05e717121703"}

The cartoon shows a man tied up in a shower with his legs trapped in a tub of concrete, in the presence of a mobster.\n2. The phrase \"cement shoes\" is often associated with the mafia and means that someone is going to be killed and thrown into the water.\n3. The man in the cartoon is tied up in a similar fashion, but is singing in the shower instead.\n4. The caption \"Stop fighting it, kid\u2014everyone eventually sings in the shower\" implies that the man is not going to be killed, but is simply being forced to sing while unable to escape.\n\nExplanation: The winning caption subverts the viewer's expectation of a dark or violent plotline by making light of the outlawed practice of cement shoes. By suggesting that the man is simply being forced to sing in the shower, the caption takes a humorous approach to a serious situation, providing viewers a quick and absurd resolution to an otherwise unpleasant scene.", "instance_id": "dc94a0c2cd1d1c4f18aa5614fabd5103"}

This creates a humorous sexual innuendo in which the man is experiencing an erection lasting longer than four hours, as warned by medical professionals.\n\nExplanation: The joke is a play on the medical warning for erections lasting longer than four hours, which creates a humorous sexual innuendo within the context of the Rapunzel fairy tale.", "instance_id": "b11d09561165a7d7145c5e7a6904bf81"}

The humor comes from the fact that he is annoyed with a task related to another classic gag item while he is literally producing a mask of his own likeness.\n\nExplanation: The humor hinges on the humorous contrast between the man's appearance and the product (Groucho Marx gag masks) he is working on. Additionally, the allusion to testing whoopee cushions is another humorous reference and adds to the punchline.", "instance_id": "82d5fd78b3b7247d1c679aaa228924e2"}

The scene seems to suggest that Zeus might be passing his godly powers to the human, or perhaps that they are collaborating.\n\nStep 2: The caption, \"you knew your wife might remarry,\" seems out of place because it doesn't directly relate to the cartoon. However, it might be interpreted as a comment on either the man's affluence (since he's dressed in a suit like a businessman) or his power (given that he is holding a lightning bolt). Moreover, the phrase suggests that the scene is part of a larger narrative or backstory that only these characters know, and that the reader is not privy to.\n\nSummary: The joke in the winning caption comes from the incongruity between the caption's statement about the man's wife and the visual and contextual details in the cartoon.

The cartoon shows a detective in bed with a man and woman, who are presumably married. This scenario is odd and unexpected, as it's not typical to have a detective in bed with a couple.\n2. The caption, \"I think my wife is having us tailed\", plays on the idea that the detective is there to keep tabs on the couple. It creates a humorous twist on the typical idea of hiring a detective to spy on someone, as instead the man in the cartoon believes his own spouse is spying on him.\n3. The humor of the caption comes from the absurdity of the situation, as it's unlikely that anyone (even a wife with trust issues) would hire a detective to join in on a menage a trois. The caption is witty and unexpected, and adds a playful element to the cartoon.\n\nExplanation: The caption \"I think my wife is having us tailed\" is funny because it turns the typical trope of hiring a detective to spy on someone on its head. Rather than the detective spying on the couple, the man in the cartoon believes his own wife is spying on him by having a detective join them in bed.

The man in the cartoon is already nervous about the wedding, and the \"living\" wedding cake is making him even more unsettled. The caption implies that the man will be able to keep his composure during the wedding ceremony, but the reception (where the cake will actually be served) is where his nerves will get the better of him.\n\nExplanation: The anthropomorphized wedding cake adds to the man's already existing nervousness about the wedding, and the winning caption plays on the idea of \"falling to pieces\" in a humorous and unexpected way.", "instance_id": "3cd22035b5aa2652715cb86e1e7027f9"}

It's a satirical commentary on the conditions of modern corporate work life, which can resemble the conditions of a lab rat on a wheel.", "instance_id": "e04ed5ecd3f09fb81c1e6d03f86ac478"}

This joke relies on a play on words between \"feathered\" as a description of hairstyle and \"feathered\" as a reference to the bird in the man's hair.", "instance_id": "974dcc1658efcbe3e212b8b24eceb098"}

The humor of the caption comes from the double meaning of \"meet remotely\" since the two men did indeed meet each other, but also suggest it is a remote meeting since neither of them belongs on this island, and they can't leave without the help.\n\nExplanation: The caption makes fun of the fact that they have met under unusual circumstances, where they are both stranded on a deserted island, therefore their meeting can be considered a remote meeting, but it's also in the literal sense that they are \"remote\" since they are stranded on a deserted island and the man is sunbathing instead of actively seeking help.

The caption plays on the idea that the driver of the car, who must have caused the accident, is presumably a teenager who was rushing home to make curfew, as if this is the only positive aspect to the entire situation.\n\nExplanation: The winning caption \"Well, at least he made curfew\" makes light of a very serious situation by implying that the only positive outcome of the accident is that the driver made it home on time.

The caption \"Still not level\" is funny because it takes a completely different angle than we would have expected: the man isn't concerned about being eaten or anything else, he only cares that the lion's head isn't hanging straight.\n\nExplanation: The caption is a witty play on the expectation of the scene and highlights the vanity of the man who went trophy hunting.

The caption subtly points out this contrast, making for a clever observation.\n\nExplanation: The caption plays on the fact that, in the horror genre, the bride of Frankenstein has a romantic partner while the woman in the cartoon is left alone despite having a vampire lover.

So, the joke is that the giant book is so big and seemingly dangerous that it's as if the person is risking losing their arm again just by reading it. \n\nExplanation: The humor in the caption comes from the hyperbole and absurdity of the suggestion that reading a giant book can cause harm similar to losing an arm to a paper cut.

However, his business attire suggests that he takes a completely different approach to the sport. \n\nStep 3: The lifeguard's statement about \"corporate thinking taking over surfing\" is a commentary on how even traditionally relaxed and free-spirited activities like surfing are now being infiltrated by corporate interests and a more business-like approach. The caption plays on the contrast between the surfer's attire and the casual beach setting and expresses a disdain for the commercialization of something that was once a simple pleasure. \n\nExplanation: The caption is funny because it satirizes the dichotomy between the surfer's appearance and the laid-back atmosphere of the beach.

The idea of a caveman using a garage to park a wheel reinforces the silliness of using a structure like a garage to store an object that could easily be kept outside.", "instance_id": "0a511b2d83360be25bb2194965be28db"}

The reference to this interrogation method in conjunction with the tranquil depiction of the angels is a humorous contradiction.\n\nStep 3: The caption also plays on the presence of the angels, suggesting that in heaven it's always \"good cop, good cop,\" implying that good deeds are always rewarded, while bad behaviors are not.\n\nExplanation: The caption utilizes a well-known police interrogation technique to make a humorous statement about the angels on the sidewalk.

Then, finish your response with a summary \"Explanation: X\" where X is a 2-3 sentence explanation of the joke.", "response": "Step 1: The cartoon takes place on Easter Island, which is known for its iconic Moai statues that have large heads and elongated features. However, in this cartoon, the Moai statues have Elvis haircuts on them, which is an unexpected and humorous twist.\n\nStep 2: The winning caption reads, \"They keep watch on the offshore accounts.\" What's interesting about this caption is the use of the word \"offshore,\" which can have two different meanings in this context. While it could refer to the offshore accounts that people sometimes use to hide their money, it could also refer to Easter Island, which is literally offshore from South America.\n\nStep 3: So, when we put everything together, the caption is a clever play on words. On one hand, it refers to the Moai statues \"keeping watch\" over something, which is a common motif in depictions of the statues. On the other hand, it also implies that the statues are financial watchdogs, which is a humorous twist. Additionally, the reference to \"offshore\" accounts is a clever nod to the fact that Easter Island is an island, and is literally offshore from the mainland. Overall, the caption is funny because it uses a pun and some clever wordplay to create a humorous juxtaposition between the Moai statues and the concept of financial oversight.\n\nExplanation: The winning caption for this New Yorker cartoon is a clever pun that uses the concept of \"keeping watch\" to create a humorous juxtaposition between the Moai statues on Easter Island and the concept of financial oversight. The use of the word \"offshore\" adds an extra layer of humor by playing on both the literal location of the island and the idiomatic use of the term in reference to financial accounts.", "instance_id": "f923f81a4de44bd02e1f014b897c2b05"}

It implies that Hargrove is not just a human, but also has a robot implant or attachment that is contributing to the decision-making process as well. This further emphasizes the AI takeover in the workplace.\n\nExplanation: The joke is that the robots are not only present in the conference room, but they are also actively participating in the decision making, to the point that they may have more \"say\" in what happens than the humans. Hargrove is singled out in particular for his apparent reliance on robotic technology, further emphasizing the theme of the AI takeover.", "instance_id": "dfde52bae0865e895a016f4ab36b4f3a"}

She completely overlooks the strange and unusual scenario. The caption provides a humorous commentary on this by suggesting that the woman believes the source of the vibration is her phone and not the giant dead alligator on the table.\n\nExplanation: The winning caption uses a humorous misdirection to play on the fact that the woman is completely indifferent to the presence of a dead alligator on a desk, and instead, is fully focused on the expectation of getting a phone call.", "instance_id": "36ec135c867ebdfc1b9cb34704b4795a"}

Thus, the joke is that the birds have finally succeeded in getting one of their own \"on the inside\" of the hunter's operation.\n\nExplanation: The winning caption uses a double meaning of \"inside\" to cleverly reference the bird on the gun \"being inside\" the hunter's plan to hunt.

The cartoon depicts a scene where a gigantic piano destroyed a house while the owners are staring at the loss.\n2.

The use of \"in tune\" signifies that the piano is in harmony, and the use of \"a little flat\" refers to the house that is literally flattened by the giant piano.\n4. The humor here lies in the clever wordplay that turns the literal scene into a musical joke.\n\nExplanation: The joke hinges on the clever wordplay of the caption, which plays with the double meaning of the musical term \"in tune\" and the architectural term \"flat\".

The caption is asking the shark about its lunch as a nonchalant way of questioning it about its possible involvement in some sort of criminal activity - which, of course, is impossible for a shark.

The lifeguard's chair is associated with a temporary job at a beach or pool, where the lifeguard only works during the summer season.\n\nExplanation: The caption humorously implies that the man is not fully invested in the job he is interviewing for, and he will leave as soon as the summer ends. The lifeguard's chair in the office is a clue for the viewer to realize that the man is not serious about the job, because the chair is typically associated with a temporary position.", "instance_id": "3ebf030134fcc8218c62e8465e33d887"}

By putting the casket in the place of the patient, the cartoon is commenting on the idea of death being a final stage in life.

In this case, the caption suggests the baseball game has been taking place inside the woman's house, rather than on a usual playing field.\n\nExplanation: The winning caption uses a humorous play on words to highlight the absurdity of having a baseball game take place indoors inside someone's living room.

Additionally, since the island is rather small, and he is the only cowboy around, it's a bit of an over-stated and ironic twist to suggest that the town (or in this case, island) is not big enough for anyone else.\n\nExplanation: The winning caption plays off of the traditional cowboy movie line, \"This town ain't big enough for the both of us\", but given the setting of the cartoon, it's a twist on the expected.

The humor lies in the juxtaposition of the absurd image of the dog wearing clothes and the relatable situation of sibling jealousy.\n\nExplanation: The humor in this caption stems from the implication that the dog is treated like a human sibling, causing the actual human child to feel left out. Once the dad's busy season is over, the dog will no longer be treated like a human, and the child can reclaim their position as the only \"child\" receiving attention.", "instance_id": "2c1b413645dac70198ef03784ec86512"}

The winning caption is a humorous observation that the man's beard and flannel shirt would suggest that he is a lumberjack. However, they are relieved that it is just a fashion trend and not his actual occupation.\n\nExplanation: The winning caption of this cartoon subverts the expectation that the man in the cartoon is a lumberjack due to his beard and flannel shirt. Instead, the joke is that his lumberjack-like appearance is just a popular look, and not his actual occupation. This plays on the idea that the man's fashion sense resembles the stereotype of a lumberjack, which is then undercut by the realization that he doesn't actually work as a lumberjack.", "instance_id": "a6543854e7447c9546d30adcc126c766"}

The caption seems to be spoken by the boy, who is jokingly questioning the credibility of the man holding the bow, potentially because he had a bad haircut.\n3. The caption is ironic as it juxtaposes the silly premise of the cherry being used as a target with the idea of trustworthiness and reliability. It's humorous because the two don't really connect, and the boy completely disregards the odd situation he's in.\n\nExplanation: The winning caption coopts the premise of archery target practice and makes it comically unrelated by having the boy question the man's trustworthiness due to a bad haircut. The contrast between the absurdity of using a cherry as a target, and the serious tone of the boy's comment, creates a humorous opposition between a silly situation and a serious tone.", "instance_id": "9fd04cd50dbb0852fdbaae4b779459fa"}

This makes it seem like the insect is struggling to read the paper, despite having many eyes.\n\nStep 3: Putting it all together, the joke seems to be that even though the insect has many eyes, it still struggles to read the paper. This plays on the idea of insects being characterized as having many eyes, but not being able to do complex human tasks like reading.\n\nExplanation: The caption plays on the common idea of flies having multiple eyes by referencing it in the context of struggling to read the paper.

The caption implies that the man's lackadaisical reaction to being stabbed is due to the fact that he hasn't gotten around to reading the note that his attacker left. \n\nExplanation: The humor in this cartoon lies in the unexpectedness of the man's nonchalant attitude towards being stabbed with a knife. The caption highlights this by emphasizing his apparent indifference and his focus on the accompanying note. The joke invites the viewer to reinterpret the act of being stabbed as a mere inconvenience to the man, a lesser annoyance as compared to the task of reading the note.", "instance_id": "06c4841d1aa057ce1a321e2356f7f85e"}

However, the winning caption does not acknowledge the strange circumstance of gravity being suspended, but instead brings attention to the man's voice. \n\nStep 3: The question posed in the caption \"Is the funny voice really worth all this trouble?\" implies that the man's voice must be amusing in some way, but the act of floating in the air while standing on a scale may not be worth it. The implication is that the man has gone to great lengths to entertain the doctor (perhaps by floating), but the payoff was not worth it.  \n\nExplanation: The joke in this New Yorker cartoon lies in the unexpectedness of the caption's focus on the man's voice while ignoring the bizarre floating action that is happening in the scene.

The word \u201cGesundheit\u201d is commonly used when someone sneezes, usually as a polite gesture wishing good health. By using this word in the context of the cartoon, it suggests that the doctor\u2019s appearance with the needles in him is so unusual that it looks like he had an explosive sneeze and accidently ended up with the needles in him. Thus, the humor lies in the unexpected nature of the doctor's appearance with the needles that resemble a sneeze, and the irony of the patient wishing the doctor good health due to the acupunture treatment. \n\nExplanation: The doctor's appearance with the needles in him looks like he's had an explosive sneeze and the patient's use of the word \"Gesundheit\" implies that the doctor looks like he needs a doctor himself.

The line \"Think it over\" suggests the cat is sizing up the situation and figuring out its next move. \n\nStep 3: The punchline in the caption is humorous because it takes the power dynamic shown in the cartoon and inverts it. Rather than the man being in control, it's the cat who wields the real power\u2014and the man is left to consider this fact. \n\nExplanation: The man's attempt to defend himself with a needle is comical in comparison to the cat's ability to protect itself.

The joke is that despite the fact that the case should be decided on legal grounds, the judge is more interested in the dancers, showing how the legal system can sometimes be arbitrary and illogical.\n\nExplanation: The winning caption makes fun of the legal system by suggesting that in this case, the judge's decision will be more influenced by something irrelevant like dancers instead of the actual merits of the case, highlighting the arbitrary and capricious nature of the legal system.", "instance_id": "5d76cb904dde2deb00d56a17e63b54b6"}

The caption plays with the idea that the man in the bunny suit is both fitting and not fitting in with the environment he is in, much like the concept of \"casual\" dress. \n\nExplanation: The caption is playing with the concept of \"casual\" dress for Good Friday, with the man dressed as a bunny in a formal office setting.

The detectives are not only talking about the crime scene but also about the scientific theory of evolution. The caption suggests that even though the evolution depicted in the chalk outline seems obvious, there will always be some who deny its existence.\n\nExplanation: The caption combines the idea of denial in a criminal investigation with the science of evolution, suggesting that some people will be hesitant to accept the scientific evidence of evolution, even in the face of a clear illustration.", "instance_id": "c9708c39401d2e134319cb661fc2c352"}

Normally, one would think most visitors would focus on the mounted unicorn head and ask questions about it. However, the speaker in the caption is surprised that someone finally asked about the clock which is presumably mundane and normal in comparison to a mounted unicorn head.\n\nStep 3: The humor comes from the unexpectedness of someone asking about the clock rather than the unusual and striking object that is the unicorn head. It's a commentary on how people can sometimes focus on mundane and trivial things while overlooking more extraordinary things in their midst.\n\nExplanation: The humor in the caption comes from the speaker expressing surprise at someone asking about the clock rather than the mounted unicorn head on the wall, which is an unusual and striking object.

In this case, the turtle is literally carrying around a book on their back, but the caption implies that they have the potential to write even more books. \n\nExplanation: The humorous twist in this caption is the combination of the literal and figurative meanings of \"having a book in you\".

The caption implies that Noah and his wife didn't necessarily choose to bring giraffes, but rather had no other choice. \n\nExplanation: The caption adds a twist to the well-known story of Noah's Ark, poking fun at how only one type of animal made it into the ark, which is contrary to the story's instruction of bringing two of every animal.

This is an unusual and awkward way to walk a dog, as it can cause confusion or even harm to the animal.\n\nStep 2: The caption introduces a divorce agreement as the source of the awkwardness, implying that the couple must share the responsibility of walking their dog even after their separation. This adds a layer of humor to the situation, as the act of sharing the dog's leash becomes a symbol of the couple's ongoing relationship.\n\nStep 3: The comedic irony in this caption lies in the fact that the most uncomfortable aspect of the former couple's agreement is not the division of assets, or any other typical detail of divorce settlements, but instead, the seemingly trivial matter of sharing their dog's leash. The humor also arises from the relatable feeling that some of us might experience in an awkward situation.\n\nExplanation: The caption plays with the idea of an unusual and uncomfortable situation between a divorced couple, and how a seemingly neutral act like walking a dog can become symbolic of the complexities and tensions of their ongoing relationship.

The severed head is not an item one would typically want to place directly on a wooden desk, hence the request to use a coaster in a seemingly absurd situation.\n\nExplanation: The winning caption for this cartoon was funny because it introduced an aspect of the mundane (the request to use a coaster) into an eerie and bizarre situation. The unexpectedness of the caption is what makes it humorous in this particular context, as its mundanity amplifies the absurdist tone of the cartoon.", "instance_id": "7b3b4921d2769d9ea00849eb92c60e10"}

The caption therefore pokes fun at the conventional wisdom of car sales tactics as well as the absurdity of the monster car.\n\nExplanation: The caption's use of a typical car sales line in the context of the absurd monster car pokes fun at conventional car sales tactics while also highlighting the absurdity of the situation.", "instance_id": "359640ab388068409de7897dfeff1e8f"}

The caption is also funny because it is unexpected; despite the fact that the cartoon shows a person turning into bubbles, it's not something the audience would expect one of the characters in the cartoon to say. \n\nExplanation: The caption \"He won't last long\" is a play on words that underscores the ephemeral nature of soap bubbles, which burst quickly, and the fact that the man is about to disappear into thin air.", "instance_id": "b247655c8111e15816bf99a1808d4753"}

The speaker in the caption makes a commentary about one of the cave people who will likely bring up their discovery of fire, which is a famously innovative technology that changed humanity's course of development. \n\nExplanation: The joke relies on the contrast between the ancient, primitive appearance of the \"cavemen\" and the modern-looking building made of sand.

The phrase \"I just don't care that much about Medicare anymore\" is also amusing because it is an unexpected response to the idea of campaigning and voting in heaven, as if the speaker is disillusioned or bored with the whole process.", "instance_id": "6cadcffed926cecbdf04d2f7ab9cd7b0"}

It also humorously subverts our usual understanding of who might benefit from therapy. \n\nExplanation: The winning caption works on the subversion of expectations and absurdity. By implying that the patient is a fish, the caption delivers a surprising and unexpected twist, thereby creating a humor.

The doctor's comment, calling it the \"most advanced case of Surrealism,\" is a clever twist that acknowledges the absurdity while also making fun of the art movement.

The winning caption \"So, for the record, are you a duck or a rabbit?\" is a comedic line that the doctor might say to a patient if the shadow puppet on the wall fools them into thinking it's real.\n\nExplanation: The caption plays on the incongruity of the shadow play in a doctor's office and pokes fun at the situation by suggesting that the shadow puppet might be a real animal, leading the doctor to question the patient's sanity.

However, this line is funny because it suggests that the way the groom is carrying his bride may be objectionable or inappropriate. The speaker is indirectly expressing his or her confusion or discomfort with what's happening in the scene.\n\nExplanation: The winning caption is amusing because it takes the viewer by surprise and highlights how unconventional and absurd the situation is.

This is likely a reference to the behavior of mosquitoes and other insect species, which are known for biting and \"taking away\" the blood of humans. \nStep 3: We read the caption, which seems to imply that the insects are seeking revenge for the death of one of their young.

In this case, the caption uses the medical meaning of \"organ donors\" to humorous effect by suggesting that the church needs to screen their organ donors more closely to avoid receiving oversized organs like the ones in the cartoon.\nExplanation: The caption humorously suggests that the church needs to be more careful when selecting their donors by alluding to the size of the organ pipes in the cartoon.", "instance_id": "f062ee5198ba3692b93bb56a5078a285"}

The humor lies in the absurdity of connecting Roswell to giant germs on an airplane.\n\nExplanation: The caption mocks the absurdity of the situation, and uses a reference to aliens to create a surprise twist in a joke that initially appears to be about germs.

In this case, the architects can't exactly return Stonehenge, so the joke is that they should have kept the box and receipt so they could exchange it for what they actually wanted to build.\n\nExplanation: The architects made a mistake and built Stonehenge instead of what they planned.

This creates a surprising twist and catches the reader off guard, leading to a humorous response.\n\nExplanation: The winning caption for this cartoon is a play on the idea of misdirection and surprise.

As the cartoon shows the people as miniature figures in comparison to the golf course, it suggests that there is a mismatch in scale and time - a 'huge' golf course and miniature people.\n- Without the context of the golf course scale, the caption would also work, but it wouldn't be as funny. \n- Therefore, the humor of the caption relies on the contrast between the mismatch of scale between the people and the golf course and the concept of \"timing\" it right.\n\nExplanation: The use of the phrase \"time it right\" in the context of the miniature people and the golf course's scale creates the humor for the caption.

The woman seems to be the therapist, and the man sitting down is possibly a patient. The winning caption, \"Crazy people have sat in yours,\" implies that the therapist might have had many patients who were considered eccentric or unstable.\n\nExplanation: The humor in this caption stems from the play on words between \"crazy\" people and therapy, suggesting that the couch has been used by many unstable individuals. The caption also subverts the expected scenario - we see the movers taking the couch away, whereas we expect the patient to be on the couch, not the therapist. This creates a comical twist that highlights the absurdity of the situation.", "instance_id": "40632faab9a309d176e5b2f2e080df71"}

By deliberately misinterpreting the icebreaker and sharing a picture of himself as \"Ted\", the speaker catches the audience off guard and generates unease, perfect for a humorous New Yorker caption.", "instance_id": "76c12a566ad5db84a9e975364fbeb5d4"}

The joke works by playing with the idea of how the chameleon's invisibility could be understood in a human context, and how this could lead to humorous misinterpretations.", "instance_id": "e0b153f5af7a8af816f64931604ba646"}

The contrast between the bird's present, giant size and her previous, small size as an intern is humorous.\n\nExplanation: The joke is a play on the idea of having a bird as an intern, but as time passed, the bird has grown to a gigantic size and is still working at the company. The humor is in the absurdity of having a giant bird in the office and the play on the word \"intern\" to describe a bird.", "instance_id": "420f9629e1fbebf9fdaa481c151088a2"}

The cartoon depicts devils herding people in an alleyway, with a manhole open and fire below, indicating that hell is located underground. The caption \"Watch your step, I think this street is paved with Good Intentions\" is a play on the phrase 'the road to hell is paved with good intentions.' This phrase is often used to describe how even well-intentioned actions can have negative consequences. In this case, the devils are literally paving the street with good intentions (since it leads to hell), and the warning to \"watch your step\" takes on a literal meaning because of the open manhole. So, through this caption, the cartoonist is pointing out the irony of the situation, and how even the devils' actions, while well-intentioned, will lead to negative outcomes. \n\nExplanation: The winning caption references the phrase 'the road to hell is paved with good intentions' and playfully subverts it, drawing humor from the irony of the situation and the literal meaning of \"watch your step.\"", "instance_id": "e747977a1833e7ca9a8c4963dddb8a14"}

The joke is based on the idea that some people may find Roman numerals difficult to read or understand, and would therefore find binary numbers especially frustrating. \n\nExplanation: The joke plays on the viewer's common experience of finding Roman numerals annoying in real life, and then exaggeratedly proposes that binary numbers would be even more frustrating for those same viewers.", "instance_id": "4a967d579d62fd954dc858c76191a332"}

By saying \"RELAX!\" to the Hulk, the caption puts the aggression into perspective, amplifying the humor of the cartoon.\n\nExplanation: The intrusion of the Hulk - a character associated with strength and violence - into a yoga studio, where relaxation and peace are the norm, is funny because it disrupts our expectations, and underscores how agitated the Hulk is.

The wolves are pretending to be a part of the herd, but instead of trying to protect the sheep, they are trying to harm them.

In this case, the phrase is used to mock the high fees charged by corporate lawyers and consultants, suggesting that their services are exotic or extravagant enough to make people feel like they have been transported to another world.\n\nExplanation: The joke is a pun on the famous phrase \"You're not in Kansas anymore.\" The caption subtly mocks the high hourly fees of corporate lawyers and consultants by using the phrase in the context of a meeting with Wizard of Oz characters, suggesting that such consultants are so exotic and otherworldly that they must charge an out-of-this-world price.", "instance_id": "d1963a45371489dd5d603dc9045d9cb5"}

Additionally, the use of the word \"orientation\" makes it seem like this distancing is some sort of protocol to be followed.

The man is expected to declare any items he is bringing with him as he is checked-in to Heaven, but the phrase \"Anything to declare?\" takes on a new meaning since he is in the afterlife.

The caption subverts our expectations by introducing a mundane and relatable situation (needing to use the restroom), but then places it in a highly unusual and absurd setting (a remote island with a tollbooth and barricade). \n\nExplanation: The caption juxtaposes a mundane request (to use the restroom) with the bizarre setting of the cartoon, highlighting the absurdity of the situation and the lack of hospitality of the island's inhabitants.", "instance_id": "3a07fb8ef5205fedd82653e19d403f9c"}

It's a humorous contrast between the serious and professional atmosphere of a job interview, and the chaotic scene happening in the backdrop.\n\nExplanation: The caption plays on the absurdity of the situation, where a man is being chased by people with weapons in an office, and suggests that this kind of chaos is not uncommon in the workplace.

The straight jackets are typically used to restrain people who are deemed a danger to themselves or others, but in this cartoon, they are being used in an office to restrain two seemingly normal people.\n\nExplanation: The caption's humor comes from the absurd pairing of the straight jackets and the business environment.

The caption also relies on the fact that dogs are often spelled words out in front of them because they understand the meaning of certain words.\n\nExplanation: The humor in the caption is that it subverts our expectations by having a dog, who is typically thought of as wanting to go for a walk, in an unlikely setting - a computer lab.

However, it's clear from the cartoon that the wall was not taken down for any practical reason, leading to a humorous notion of the couple taking down the wall in order to have this conversation.\n\nExplanation: The caption plays on the idea that a wall being taken down must be a practical action with clear intentions, but in the cartoon, the wall is being taken down without a practical purpose.

The \"modern architecture\" referred to in the caption is the hole in the ground, which contrasts with the more traditional, natural caves that the caveman is choosing to live in.\n\nStep 3: Explanation: The caption is funny because it takes a term usually associated with complex buildings and structures, and applies it to a simple hole dug in the ground for shelter by cavemen.

The caption uses a pun on the word \"twist\" as both a physical trait of the wind-up toy, and a figurative twist on the concept of office politics.\n\nExplanation: The humor of the cartoon lies in the unexpected twist of the wind-up toy figures in an office space, but the caption takes it a step further by making a witty pun involving the concept of \"twist\" and office politics. The added element of \"backstabbing\" just makes the caption even more amusing and relevant to the office environment.", "instance_id": "671ffc3196a5a0358257a4d433026dd7"}

The caption references \"leaving England,\" implying that Harry (who is a name commonly associated with British royalty) has come to the U.S. to get away from the public eye and blend in, but he's not actually doing a very good job of blending in.\n3. The humor comes from the fact that the man in the cartoon is obviously not actually Prince Harry, but because he's dressed like a king, the caption plays with the idea of mistaken identity and the idea of people trying to hide in plain sight.\n\nExplanation: The caption is a play on the idea of Prince Harry trying to blend into public life in the U.S. after stepping back from royal duties, but he's doing a poor job of it by walking around in regal attire. The joke hinges on the humorous concept of mistaken identity and the expectation of blending in with one's surroundings.", "instance_id": "c113550f5ec8378089129ab98ad0182e"}

In other words, the safe-man is not annoyed by the burden of carrying the safe but by being accused of bringing the safe as a carry-on. \n\nExplanation: The caption plays with our expectation of a typical airline complaint, and creates a twist that reveals the safe-man is not annoyed by the safe itself, but by being accused of bringing the safe as a carry-on.", "instance_id": "70071924e6b209e8fb0726e1c3dc751e"}

The caption plays off of the common medical phrase, \"This may burn a little,\" by making a humorous connection between the magnifying glass and the phrase, implying that the magnifying glass might cause a burn.

The men look as though they are starving and in severe distress. However, the caption says \"I'm thinking about quitting the band\", which is both unexpected and humorous.\n\nThe humor comes from the unexpected contrast between the dire circumstances of the men and the seemingly nonchalant remark of the band member who is contemplating leaving the band. By using such a statement in this context, the caption draws attention to how absurd the situation is, making it funny.\n\nExplanation: The marching band member's casual reaction to the dire situation emphasizes the absurdity of the situation and creates a humorous contrast.", "instance_id": "d812f801c8ee87491ea50a3e46cfeedc"}

This explanation is unexpected, and plays on the idea that sometimes the most absurd and simple explanations are the funniest.", "instance_id": "0cf8fd0b1f5428c95bd02605bd9c2bf4"}
