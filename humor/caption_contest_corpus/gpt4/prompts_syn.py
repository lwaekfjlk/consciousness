You will be given several sentences describing a thought process which should eventually contain a final answer, either A, B, C, D, or E. Your job is to extract the final answer that the explanation arrives at.

Some things to remember:

- Keep your answers short: only output "Final Answer: X" where X is A, B, C, D, or E.
- If the explanation doesn't mention a final choice explicitly, you can output "Unknown"'''

    ('''Since the scene takes place in an arena with a matador and a bull, the scenario is most likely related to bullfighting. However, the uncanny description states that they are dancing together, which is unexpected since they are supposed to fight. Caption A ("Costco") does not seem to relate to the scenario in any clear way. Caption B ("Mother wore this color") does not relate to the scenario or the uncanny description. Caption C ("That's the last time we brag about our kids") seems to be trying to play off of the idea that the dance looks like a family activity, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Caption D ("Remember: at the dip, I gore you") seems to be playing off of the idea that the matador is going to be attacked by the bull, but again it doesn't quite seem to fit the scenario. Caption E ("Trust me. You're not alone.") does not seem to relate to the scenario in any clear way. 

Given the above analysis, the caption that seems to fit the scene of the cartoon and the uncanny description of the dancing is caption C, "That's the last time we brag about our kids." Therefore, the answer is: C.''', 'Final Answer: C'),
    ('''First, looking at caption A: "They're right on time; they're trained like mice." This caption is humorous because the mice are actually wearing lab coats and holding clipboards, implying that they have been trained for some scientific experiment. The phrase "trained like mice" is a play on the expression "trained like animals". This caption relies on the absurdity of imagining mice wearing clothes and acting like people, which is a classic element of humor.

Caption B: "O.K., let's slowly lower in the grant money." This caption is humorous because it implies that the grant money is the motivation for the experiment, rather than the betterment of scientific knowledge. However, this caption seems to be less funny than Caption A because it relies on a more common and predictable idea.

Based on these reasons, I think the funnier caption is A: "They're right on time; they're trained like mice."''', 'Final Answer: A')]
