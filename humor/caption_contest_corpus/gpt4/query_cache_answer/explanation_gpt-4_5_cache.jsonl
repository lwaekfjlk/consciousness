In the cartoon, the neighbors carrying a lit bomb misunderstood the abbreviation and thought it meant \"Bring Your Own Bomb\".

I am the owner and I approve this message.\n\nExplain the joke/how the caption relates to the cartoon in 2-3 sentences.", "response": "Here's my best explanation: The waiter speaking into a mic at a podium resembles a political candidate giving a speech and endorsing themselves.

The ghost has a nonchalant attitude about the mistake, making light of a typical grave and serious medical malpractice situation, thereby creating an unexpectedly humorous context.", "instance_id": "fbc802c4bfecde233bd251f55d34965f"}

It plays on the fact that therapists listen to their patients' concerns (listening with their ears), implying the mismatch in the patient's expectation. The patient is humorously wondering if it would have been more appropriate for the therapist to be sitting in a giant ear-shaped couch, as an ode to the act of listening.", "instance_id": "c04f0ea8fe63b07a5df7049e11e10d64"}

The joke lies in the fact that instead of admitting that he shouldn't be wearing boxing gloves while attempting to play, he deflects the situation by stating that he \"could have been a conductor.\" The humor here arises from the absurdity of his choice to wear boxing gloves and his offhand remark about being a conductor as an alternative way of participating in music.", "instance_id": "a7fdff25cdde44fc030b4f0e815f44dc"}

The woman's caption suggests that the man in the suit needs to be burped after his conference call as if he were a baby, highlighting the ridiculous contrast between his adult responsibilities and his infant-like situation in the cradle.", "instance_id": "de27a9951f44bcd0cd7fb4c61da7d717"}

The man in the box, however, avoids the sun completely and worries about his pale complexion instead.

The joke lies in the mundane attempt of self-improvement; suggesting that cows, incapable of perceiving or modifying colors, would consider changing their typically black and white or brown appearance to a hue like mauve (a pale purple color).", "instance_id": "2d05d5b24710aacf3e86ca24d8d13e99"}

In this scenario, Death is giving food to a man, but making lemonade is not an option because Death typically signifies the inevitability of demise, rather than an opportunity to overcome challenges.

In the cartoon, vendors at the pyramid have a punny parallel of \"pyramid scheme\" and \"selling hot dogs on actual pyramids.\" The joke is a play on how the hot dog business might be mismanaged if the literal pyramid was the setting.", "instance_id": "aacdb06ec84d00d1de333c68f033b169"}

In this case, God is depicted wearing Groucho glasses, a comedic disguise, while advising Moses that \"it's all in the timing,\" which is actually a famous principle in comedy.

The man says \"I feel like seafood tonight\" - not realizing the bizarre implications of saying this with a mermaid sitting right next to him. The mermaid is visibly worried, potentially because she wonders if the man has any interest in eating her, as she is considered seafood.", "instance_id": "332b2e29b292e3a0321822c49d1ba654"}

In this case, the therapist is adding another layer of complexity by asking a patient how they feel about how the person beneath them feels about another person's feelings.

However, when the man asked for help with shoveling snow, the woman took the word \"accompany\" quite literally by playing her guitar alongside him, instead of helping him with the physical task.

The statement \"we sue at dawn\" is a funny mixing of the modern business world, where lawsuits are often a part of disputes, and the ancient battles fought between warriors (like Mongols) that began with the declaration \"we ride at dawn.\" It's the blending of two very different times and methods of settling disputes.", "instance_id": "8876190d688eef6e0126130d8c5340f8"}

The bird in the nest, however, is playing a guitar like a human would, making traditional bird calls impossible to distinguish. The joke is that the bird is \"covering\" a song from a human musician, rather than singing its natural song, which confuses the birdwatchers.", "instance_id": "751c65d41bc6f44c66f54daae27167ea"}

They are holding a pen and notepad and are looking at a woman who is in the middle of digging a hole in the floor.\nuncanny description: A therapist office is usually in an office building with a concrete or wood floor so it's unusual to see a person digging a hole in the middle of the office and a therapist taking notes like it's normal.\nentities: Digging, Shovel\nCaption: During next week's session, we'll have you paint yourself into a corner.\n\nExplain the joke/how the caption relates to the cartoon in 2-3 sentences.", "response": "Here's my best explanation: The joke is a play on common sayings that are not meant to be taken literally. \"Digging a hole\" is often used metaphorically to describe someone getting themselves into a difficult, self-sabotaging situation, but the woman has hilariously taken it literally. Similarly, the therapist's suggestion to \"paint herself into a corner\" is meant as a figurative expression, but in the context of this humorous cartoon, it implies that the therapist wants her to perform another absurdly literal act as part of her therapy.", "instance_id": "da4e645b8d5511729ff050a1193a48a0"}

The punchline combines the absurdity of a unicorn being in an office setting, and the humorous suggestion that the reason it's in the office is because the secretary couldn't find a three-hole punch, implying that perhaps the unicorn could provide similar functionality with its single horn, albeit ineffectively.", "instance_id": "d6ad08cfe235a2b4439e00ff2e8102e6"}

The caption humorously assumes that the bull has had previous matador partners who met their end in a bullfight, while also playing on the idea of a dance partnership where one person might ask another about their previous dance partners.", "instance_id": "f53670480141593c90cb58f494f87646"}

In this case, the scientist dressed like a rat is taking this concept to an extreme by wearing a rat costume, as if blending in with the mice could help him get more accurate research data.", "instance_id": "132cdfa9eed2fd6b991f32808186c196"}

The caption plays on this stereotype by having the parent elephant express disbelief that his offspring, despite being an elephant, is unable to remember something as simple as a password.", "instance_id": "788c25dd2e625c1dd1c3c54bd1a0b97d"}

In this scenario, the leaves are personified and one of them is \"breaking up\" with the other by detaching from the branch. The phrase \"It's not you. It's November.\" is a play on the classic breakup line \"It's not you, it's me\" but is now referring to their natural detachment in the fall season.", "instance_id": "76f984e27482140433af8828a75135a4"}

In this cartoon, the word \"recess\" is used as a pun, implying that during this break the adults, generally dressed formally for court proceedings, are enjoying some playtime on a playground's slide like kids. The contrast between the formality of court and the silliness of adults going down slides is what makes the caption humorous.", "instance_id": "c44c9f243a26f5eee5e4f0000f8e52cc"}

Usually, when people go on roller coasters or feel fear, their response is to scream and be terrified, but the calm woman in the front seems unfazed by it all.

The lawyer is telling him to wear the shorts, since other people must bear witness after him --- suggesting that the witness might be naked or not wearing appropriate attire.

The joke comes from the unusual setting and situation: instead of a secret fight club, these business people have a clandestine s'mores club, where they roast marshmallows over a burning conference table. It's funny because it contrasts the serious tone and exclusivity found in the movie with the light-hearted and absurd activity of roasting marshmallows indoors.", "instance_id": "a42ce147e275be8c968302b75af3e572"}

However, the wife is not impressed and calls him out for having a \"holier-than-thou\" attitude, a phrase used to describe someone who acts superior to others in terms of morality or spirituality.

They are so concerned about staying safe that they wear hazmat suits even to bed, and this unusual commitment to protection means their sexual encounters could be very impersonal for a long time. The line implies that one partner is questioning whether the point of all these precautions has been forgotten, or if they should liberate themselves within the context of their intimate relationship.", "instance_id": "b21186dd508ca8165a584719c703c211"}

Often, people flip a coin to determine who goes first or which side to choose. Instead, the man and woman are playing ping pong in the courtroom, suggesting that they didn't have a coin, so they're settling their conflict or determining who goes first with a game of ping pong, which is unexpected and humorous.", "instance_id": "8d4bebf30464672217ae1c76cac5ce38"}

There seems to be a missing groomsman.\nentities: Vikings, Weapon\nCaption: They met at the opera\n\nExplain the joke/how the caption relates to the cartoon in 2-3 sentences.", "response": "Here's my best explanation: The joke refers to the stereotype that Vikings often appear in operas, specifically, in Richard Wagner's opera \"The Ring Cycle\" with its iconic horned helmets. The caption humorously suggests that the couple, dressed like Vikings at their wedding, met while attending or performing in an opera, rather than as a result of any real Viking lineage.", "instance_id": "68db3d35e95c6a7e2b8ed54ee86b2089"}

By having tiny men with desks on their heads, it shows a literal interpretation of that phrase. The caption humorously comments on the tiny men's printers being in their pants, which adds to the physical discomfort and awkwardness of having the workplace literally on their minds.", "instance_id": "84b412d002e357bab2298c2d843704fa"}

The nude man takes this advice to an extreme, probably to avoid checking luggage or to reduce the weight of his carry-on bag. His choice to be naked on the plane humorously highlights the absurdity of this particular strategy.", "instance_id": "b88d0290d413d220c483f9fae79870dd"}

Since the presence of aliens in unexpected contexts is often a humorous device employed in various cartoons, one alien is offering another a cartoon idea while unknowingly being a part of a cartoon themselves. The humor comes from the fact that they don't seem to realize they are already part of a cartoon with aliens, making the suggestion redundant and ironically funny.", "instance_id": "23326946b9e34846b7f8ff8af789fa17"}

In this case, the joke is that instead of wearing a button (which might display the wearer's opinion on the contentious issue or a similar expression of thoughts), the man has chosen to bring an actual elephant into the room, humorously taking the idiomatic expression literally.

The presence of the Grim Reaper, who is the personification of death, implies that when he plays as the \"closer,\" it's the ultimate form of closing as no one can escape death.

The interviewer addresses the Sphinx\u2014a historical, mythical creature that has already existed for thousands of years\u2014by asking where it sees itself in 5,000 years.

The humorous aspect comes from the fact that the woman seems to be enjoying the date regardless and is completely unfazed by the unconventional choice of both location (the Moscow Airport) and the man's bag-mask.

The factory adding a cream topping to the cars and the mention of cherries in the caption suggests they're making the cars like sundaes or cakes, which is a playful absurd concept. The recall of cherries indirectly mocks real-life recalls in the car industry due to some faulty components or issues.", "instance_id": "093d66099f242cc411ee761f9194c604"}

The customer's calm statement \"He'll be back\" is funny because it contrasts with the dramatic situation, suggesting they are used to bizarre occurrences at this barbershop, or that the barber is going to just come back from this incident unfazed.", "instance_id": "ae3427c3e0215e37320a0bb4708bb18d"}

The caption humorously implies that the man, like a child during a separation or divorce, would prefer to live with another (in this case, his \"dad\") due to the uncomfortable or unwanted situation.", "instance_id": "21133ffd632a5c989f329c89126aaba8"}

In this cartoon, though, the couple has literally flipped the house by sitting upside down. The humor comes from this extreme solution to avoiding the messy room below them; instead of cleaning up, they've chosen to defy gravity and completely change their perspective.", "instance_id": "441a301318afcafa6fa767269879ab49"}

The joke here is that the aliens may have come to Earth as a result of these \"no side effects\" claims, but they are clearly unexpected visitors.

I wouldn't prescribe anything I haven't tested on myself.\n\nExplain the joke/how the caption relates to the cartoon in 2-3 sentences.", "response": "Here's my best explanation: The joke is based on the fact that many drugs/medical treatments are often tested on rats before they are given to humans, which has led to the popular phrase \"lab rat.\" In this cartoon, the doctor is literally a \"rat man\" and is reassuring the patient that he has tested the prescription on himself, a rat.

In the cartoon, the appearance of a monster truck at a classical music performance suggests an incongruent pairing with the orchestra, leading to amusing and unexpected results.", "instance_id": "05d81013b5ec01078ae2ffb81be7e693"}

So, the joke is that the beaver uses a phrase (\"I'll go see what's holding things up\") that normally means investigating an issue or delay but, in this case, it has a double meaning and also refers to what's LITERALLY holding the tree up after it's been cut all the way through.", "instance_id": "081cb85f853ea038162c99ebac8bfb51"}

However, the observing peacock jokingly comments that they'd only be impressed if the displaying peacock could use his feathers for a practical purpose, like dusting. This adds a humorous twist by anthropomorphizing the peacocks and having them focus on mundane human concerns instead of their usual mating rituals.", "instance_id": "c7d79c8a3cf08e809f9c6cb856240b22"}

The defense attorney raises an objection, pointing out that the whale is only an \"alleged\" killer, poking fun at the absurdity of the name and the surreal situation in a courtroom.", "instance_id": "ad8416d0ad37088d007058217307ded5"}

The joke suggests that the couple in the counseling office is seeking help due to their emotional distance and separation, as represented by the way their chair positions defy normal expectations.

It's usually assumed that bulls are invited to barbecues to be cooked as food, but this bull is enjoying himself by jumping off the diving board. So, the person asks whether the bull knows the real reason it was invited, creating a humorous situation as the bull remains unaware of its fate.", "instance_id": "9d0227fecd224d38c59c6a427af69810"}

In this context, \"uncoupled\" also signifies a break-up between the train and its significant other. The humor lies in the double meaning of \"uncoupled\" as well as the surreal appearance of a train at a bar, using alcohol to drown its sorrows.", "instance_id": "31fe9f541b364a237d3af4626fd820a9"}

But, due to economic constraints, people are finding it harder to afford traveling. The joke in the caption is that because the man can't afford to travel to different locations, he is physically preparing himself for various vacation activities and hoping that the experiences will just happen around him, rather than him having to travel to actual vacation destinations.", "instance_id": "891fa18253fe23c6f4afa01c3ba52199"}

The joke here is that the woman has her own retreat\u2014an exaggerated \"nest\" high up in a tree.

The joke plays on the idea that both the wheel and the traffic ticket were invented by the same person (the caveman). The irony is that the caveman, who invented something groundbreaking (the wheel), is now being ticketed by the modern world's evolution of transportation (the motorcycle-riding police officer).", "instance_id": "08ab39704cdf3b1cf8035c82ee0ffd84"}

However, in this situation, walking the plank is not so perilous given the plank is only a subway platform.

The rat is trying to encourage the pigeon not to worry about his makeshift wings by explaining that he has participated in far more dangerous or uncomfortable experiments when he was a test subject for drugs.

Here, the sheep dog\u2014a worker\u2014is the one that has difficulty sleeping, but ironically he can't stop thinking about work (managing sheep) which is what people think about when they count sheep to fall asleep.

One of the interns tries to console himself or show off by mentioning that his previous internship wasn't quite as bad, as he was only used as a coatrack, also a humorously demeaning comparison.", "instance_id": "a62df2dd2e35322bfadb17d34991a25f"}

The caption humorously suggests that the cowboy is adamantly refusing to \"go back to timeout\", which is a form of punishment often given to children.

The man carrying the surfboard wants the secretary to inform his next appointment that he's running late or won't be able to make it because of unexpectedly \"gnarly\" surfing conditions, a statement that is humorously out of place in a professional setting.", "instance_id": "271f1fb21b6b5e6253000d3005dede15"}

The phrase \"Are you now, or have you ever been?\" is associated with anti-communist hearings where it was frequently asked, but the joke here is that the person being questioned is an \"empty suit,\" indicating that there is no substance or accountability to be found.

The joke here is that one person admits to using some kind of a pick-up line to get the other person into the bedroom, and \"fishing\" illustrates the metaphor they used to do so.", "instance_id": "63dd6b7abb5e5f1cad5ff78f8f7292e0"}

The man's explanation of his bedroom being where the \"sleep\" happens implies that he has designated various rooms for different activities, and he considers his living room to be the place for magic performances.

Instead of being alarmed or scared, the owner of the snake attempts to comfort the other man (with the dog) by saying that his snake only likes to eat dachshunds (a breed of dog).

Since courts enforce the law, they might do things like convict criminals or charge people with fines.

The Supreme Court judges, positioned in beds (rather than traditional seats), are requesting a story from the speaker playing into the bedtime vibe. The humor comes from the contrast between the serious, formal nature of a court hearing, and the casual intimacy of a bedtime story.", "instance_id": "3cae7d0f7fb217321b7d41188cc921e9"}

However, in this scenario, the man has been shot by numerous arrows, resulting in significant discomfort.

What if your sister-in-law is also right about God?\n\nExplain the joke/how the caption relates to the cartoon in 2-3 sentences.", "response": "Here's my best explanation: The joke relies on the fact that encountering a mythological creature such as a yeti should lead the hikers to rethink the validity of other claims that was previously considered false, like beliefs held by their sister-in-law.

Many medicines have side effects that cause physical abnormalities.

By saying \"I'll see you later,\" the person wearing the camera on their head is subtly implying that they will rewatch the vlog footage of the people and conversations around them later on.

In this case, the joke is that the intrusion is physical, with the sword literally \"hacking\" through their desk, which both startles them and suggests that their office is under attack.

The caption humorously suggests that \"the gravy boat,\" a term often used to describe a sauce dish, is in reality an actual boat needed to accommodate a chicken of that size.

Apparently, the man is named Henry and he's climbing in the window, naked. It seems he just got caught in a lie, and the woman humorously questions if he is capable of being fully honest with her, probably about other issues as well.

The joke lies on the paradox of the free birds having another bird as a pet, confined to a cage while they are in their natural habitat raising baby birds.

The kings are literally in a hammock which means that they cannot be \"overthrown\" (since they aren't seated on a throne).

It is funny that the police officer is dressed as a clown and using a situation from a circus \u2013 clowns piling into a tiny car for comedic effect \u2013 as a threat to make the suspect talk, because this situation is so absurd and far removed from the serious context of a police interrogation.", "instance_id": "116860134ca1c37ffe5a9c0a7507884f"}

The caption is a humorous reference to a common human experience - that awkward moment when you laugh while eating or drinking and food or liquid comes out of your nose.

The joke in the caption is a relatable human excuse for being late, but it's humorous since it's coming from a giraffe, which does not usually drive or deal with traffic lights.

The naked executives symbolize full transparency, suggesting the company is willing to expose all its financial secrets to the stockholders.

The cowboy on a seahorse is saying \"It's big and blue. You can't miss it,\" perhaps referring to the ocean (a place where a seahorse could live or was found).

In real life, dogs and cats are often viewed as enemies, so a cat leading a group of dogs goes against that stereotype and emphasizes that the cat didn't care about pleasing others or fitting expectations.

The word \"dough\" typically means the money in colloquial English; however, in this context, it also refers to the dough used to make pizza, since the man is dressed as a chef.

However, in this cartoon, the chefs are fixing a truck instead of cooking food, which implies that they're more focused on the greasy work of being mechanics.

The joke comes from the fusion of two separate locations (an office and a subway train). When Frank says he'll be late because he's \"stuck at the office,\" it's funny because the \"office\" is, in this case, the subway train itself, so there should be no reason for Frank to be late to the meeting that's happening right there.", "instance_id": "fadf3a2284f768e9346e13bf4229d1d8"}

The instructor's comment, \"We get it. You're straight,\" implies that the man carrying a rug is making a show of his (perceived) straightness, as if to avoid using a yoga mat, which might be seen as less traditionally masculine.

As the giant squid is attacking the bridge full of people, one of the two arguing men shifts the focus to a hypothetical previous decision, trying to act blameless for the current chaotic situation.

However, in the cartoon, there's a play on words with the scene taking place in an actual cloud in the sky.

The caption has Moses sharing an amusingly nonsensical commandment involving zodiac animals which is not a part of the standard Ten Commandments, and that absurdity makes it funny.", "instance_id": "dcd124c3a704e8397be3c6d18a7c3515"}

In this scenario, the scientist suggests they should have \"salted the roads\" for an entirely different reason: for killing the giant snail, as salt is deadly to snails.

In this scene, the mobster wants the tied-up man to \"sing\" --- slang for \"reveal information\" or \"confess\" (usually under pressure)- and the whole setup with the concrete is a threatening way to get him to spill the beans. But the mobster is making light of the situation, using the idiom \"sing in the shower\" (which would be about ordinary people literally singing) as a joke to emphasize the man's precarious, but inevitable situation.", "instance_id": "dc94a0c2cd1d1c4f18aa5614fabd5103"}

Instead of referring to the health of the gingerbread man, the doctors and bakers are predicting that he won't survive the holidays because gingerbread men are a popular holiday treat and people will likely eat him before the season ends. So, it's more due to his popularity as a dessert than due to any health issues.", "instance_id": "e3aad0272e35eb64edbd8b701a5809b3"}

The caption implies that the presence of this odd statue must be due to a lax immigration policy for new statues, treating them as if they were people who moved to the island.

The hiker might have been looking for spiritual wisdom or enlightenment from the old man at the top of the mountain. Instead, the old man is a Piano teacher (or the hiker has a piano teacher's voice in his head guiding his inner musician), and the misunderstood advice was actually about playing the piano with more attitude.

The joke is a play on words involving the mythical creature, the Abominable Snowman (also known as Yeti).

The man, perhaps seeking a way to lift his spirits or deal with stress, ends up with a giant, literal barrel of monkeys instead of seeking an easier solution, like taking Prozac, which is a medication often prescribed for mood disorders.

The sudden destruction of the couple's living room wall by a wrecking ball leads them to jokingly attribute the cause to Miley Cyrus, as if she had brought her music video antics to their home.", "instance_id": "58f479ee786f4ac2faa5321559a1ed7f"}

The therapist, recognizing the situation, uses a classic therapy line about feeling \"manipulated,\" which in this case has a literal meaning, as the couple is manipulating the puppets rather than directly communicating.", "instance_id": "50ddba203ec26cf7afcd90298303cc04"}

In this cartoon, Batman is taking the subway, which is highly unusual and implied as somewhat embarrassing for him.

The joke is that there's a room full of pianos, and the man is treating them as if they were living creatures, producing baby grand pianos from the adult ones.", "instance_id": "4369a7300d9315c3217fb769a7bd5028"}

The joke lies in the surprising combination of a bath and bunk bed, making the bottom-bunk person seem like an infamous character in a whimsical and unexpected scenario.", "instance_id": "fdbb3767be2b25d4e25654fc516e26d2"}

In one sense, the guest is promoting their upcoming movie, which will be \"released\" in theaters. But, the other sense of \"released\" in this case suggests that the guest herself may be confined, possibly in rehab or prison, and is due to be \"released\" at the same time as her movie.", "instance_id": "d6e4664157ae4fe87038dc77b1de4f09"}

The moon appears to have a playful emoticon-like face, which is clearly an unusual and temporary appearance. The caption \"I think it's just a phase\" is a double entendre, referring both to the phases of the moon and to the idea that the moon's current appearance is a temporary, quirky mood.

The woman finds this group unsatisfactory for her purposes, so she sarcastically expresses her desire to try out group therapy with a different group.

The pirate who's witnessing this is probably amused or impressed by this unexpected twist, with the caption \"I can't believe my eye!\" alluding to the stereotypical pirate with an eyepatch, who would usually say \"I can't believe my eyes!\" but has only one eye to be surprised with.", "instance_id": "d7089241b1d334aa8be69df678c73178"}

The joke here is that the writer, perhaps a psychiatrist, is present in the huddle, which is completely unexpected, trying to help the players with their emotional state and encourage them to address their emotional defensiveness rather than their tactical football defense.", "instance_id": "e4e06cb9e9f79a767866899579b1e77c"}

In this scene, the joke is that the fish is talking like a human while also interpreting the phrase quite literally, since it's likely the fish will end up canned in the food industry - it's a pun on the fish's potential fate.", "instance_id": "1592efd512f8263bdd474108eee23ec6"}

We don't test on animals.\n\nExplain the joke/how the caption relates to the cartoon in 2-3 sentences.", "response": "Here's my best explanation: The joke revolves around the idea that humans would test on themselves rather than on animals. The man in the business attire running on the hamster wheel implies that he's participating in some kind of experiment for a company.

In the cartoon, the man has a literal bird with feathers in his hair. The humor comes from him asking the barber to trim his hair without disturbing the bird, which adds a silly, absurd twist to the use of \"feathered\" in the context of hair styles.", "instance_id": "974dcc1658efcbe3e212b8b24eceb098"}

The cartoon exaggerates this by transforming the typical office space into an over-sized sandbox, akin to what children play in, taking the notion of \"playing well with others\" quite literally, adding a touch of absurdity to the situation that makes it humorous.", "instance_id": "17de577841bf1bd1d7f2dbdb20145dde"}

In this cartoon, the phrase is changed to \"long time no sea,\" which is a pun that refers to the fact that the man rowing a boat is in a desert, meaning there is no water (sea) around.

Instead of an actual deer, the caveman has drawn a stick figure version of deer. The joke is that the caveman would rather paint the deer than hunt them, hence he calls himself a \"painter-gatherer\", combining his artistic inclinations with his presumed role in the society.", "instance_id": "69871b70078563b085418c0959220ff5"}

The stranded woman's comment, \"There's water everywhere,\" is a humorous observation of the literal abundance of water around the island, while also implying the nonsensical nature of the plumber's appearance in such a location.

Instead of panicking or being angry about the damage, they humorously focus on the silver lining that their child made it home by curfew, which might be something the parents were strict about.

The caption humorously implies that the settler, attracted by the spotlights in the distance, abandons the traditional destination of Oregon for the more tempting and exciting option of Las Vegas.", "instance_id": "3325627b3151a3e4f29e160aabde2ac0"}

The caption humorously suggests that the grasshopper's antennae can pick up radio signals from faraway places like Santa Fe, like an old TV antenna.

In the past, people would worry about their phone lines being tapped, but they likely never imagined that monstrous privacy invasions could escalate to the point of a huge monster literally peering into their meetings instead. The joke is based on the ridiculous level of escalation in surveillance.", "instance_id": "7bcedc68ceea65129a753b126a12bb54"}

Here, the woman is poking fun at the scenario, implying that she desires affection from the vampire, and jokingly assumes that the bride of Frankenstein, another classic monster, has a better romantic life with cuddling involved. The juxtaposition of classic monsters with romantic situations creates the humor.", "instance_id": "c70ce77a384d394e28cb7894858ee206"}

However, by handling dangerously large books, he has risked injury and lost an arm to a giant paper cut. The woman is frustrated and expresses her concern for his well-being.

I have a wife and two thousand kids!\n\nExplain the joke/how the caption relates to the cartoon in 2-3 sentences.", "response": "Here's my best explanation: The fish is trying to appeal to the bear's empathy, by claiming it is a parent and provider, a common situation humans and most animals find themselves in. However, the joke lies in the fact that fish (specifically salmon) are known to have a huge number of offspring, which makes the fish's plea comically exaggerated and unlikely to deter the bear.", "instance_id": "71a06a700f80e8f697826108b0dcf6dd"}

Instead of the traditional \"Grim Reaper,\" who represents Death and usually wears a long, black robe, this Reaper is wearing casual athletic clothes, like a hoodie and pants.

However, given that the exact same scenario is now playing out right before his eyes, the pirate's sense of originality and creativity feels robbed, hence he claims, \"There goes my novel.\" The humor lies in the clash between the pirate's perception of an inventive idea for a novel and the reality before him.", "instance_id": "fbec948d0e146854c01958193fdde2a9"}

A garage would usually be used to park a car, but back then, the only \"vehicle\" they had was the wheel, referring to the invention of the wheel.

The humor lies in the absurdity of these characters from different stories being together, and Captain Ahab, who is known for his stern demeanor, must navigate this whimsical world where the characters skip down the yellow brick road by admitting he can't skip himself.

But the man talking to the bartender uses \"waltzed,\" a dancing term, to tell the ballerina that her target already left. It's a play on words since she is a dancer, but also highlights the unusual, mixed-up situation of a ballerina in a bar looking for someone with a gangster-like demeanor.", "instance_id": "d9a2c28d4949d38fa6c4fa689822c915"}

So, the joke is that \"in\" that circumstance, it's a choice between going out instead. *Here*, the two people are \"in\" a jail cell: they cannot realistically leave, so there's no choice between staying in or going out; they must stay in.", "instance_id": "622e678396e624be208a465ec6af8532"}

In this case, the tiny man at the party has taken it literally and uses the term \"mini bar\" to explain where he met the person he's talking to, as if the mini bar had some sort of literal shrinking effect on him, which leaves him small in size compared to the other guests.", "instance_id": "2bf340a5fc8ff07c033457d36447d448"}

The fact that all the men look identical highlights the homogeneity, and potential lack of understanding/insight, of those responsible for making important decisions affecting women, since women themselves seem to be underrepresented in these groups.

The turkey has women legs wearing fishnets and high heels, a stereotypical image of seduction.

In the cartoon, the baker is in an alley, literally offering the woman a cake, so the humor comes from the twist on the popular phrase to describe an unusual and unexpected situation.", "instance_id": "a069e1d82802bd18f2d9312725b91c4d"}

Fishbowls traditionally have little objects like tiny castles for decoration, which provides a sense of comfort to the fish. The man in the fishbowl workspace makes a sarcastic comment about his previous workplace, mentioning it had a castle, which is a metaphorical way to say his previous office was grander or more enjoyable compared to his current setup.", "instance_id": "4c77d615674e2e883f7b487046ca56ab"}

The caption\u2014\"Oh, hey, I almost didn't recognize you outside of work\"\u2014adds to the humor by portraying the characters' historical struggle (Captain Ahab's obsession with hunting Moby-Dick) as if it were just another mundane job, and they happen to be running into each other during their off time.", "instance_id": "93ba25ce19186f7f746374b3c1f680cd"}

The humor lies in the absurd connection between the two, as if the Can-can dancers (who are known for their energetic leg movements) might face similar dismemberment. The caption suggests that the woman should avoid any possible harm to the dancers by keeping them away from a seemingly dangerous group, the gingerbread men.", "instance_id": "86c1a6d134a57083db2b6578ab216715"}

The businessmen are overwhelmed by the physical cash they have to transport, implying that the idea of people actually giving money to a bank seems ironic or surprising to them.

Knowing that sharks typically eat a lot without remembering the specifics of their meals, the question seems absurd. Additionally, it also draws humor from the fact that the police are engaging with a dangerous, non-verbal animal in the same manner as they would with a human suspect.", "instance_id": "f6fd54fc17e9f1dacc50eb6d10043aea"}

The idea is that real horses might be less appealing to younger people, but using toy horses, which are associated with children, will make the sport more engaging for them.", "instance_id": "434fff828d83112ef156117de030030d"}

It sounds very similar to the word \"heal\" which means to recover from an illness or injury. In this scenario, the doctor says \"heal\" to the man dressed like a dog instead of offering medical advice or prescribing medications, creating a pun that plays on this homophone.", "instance_id": "129efada62809048426cdd3c48e0fb61"}

The humorous part comes from the cowboy's reaction, which treats the situation as if it were a minor inconvenience, like finding a parking ticket on his car, instead of the absurdity of his horse decomposing to just a skeleton.", "instance_id": "65f429f15881a1ad8118a6dfa5f60aff"}

Usually, people will just write their name on their foods in shared spaces (like an office kitchen) to avoid confusion or theft. But, this person has gone to the extreme and set up elaborate deadly traps to guard their food in the refrigerator.

The humor comes from the woman taking advantage of this odd situation by checking if she has something in her teeth, instead of being polite and focused on the conversation or meal with the man.", "instance_id": "46b4186daf5845b1214091942ac24d72"}

In this cartoon, these desert wanderers are crawling, likely due to dehydration and suffering. The caption humorously implies that their crawling might have a purpose like those marathon participants, despite their dire situation.", "instance_id": "f028febf04cd2b4ef29bf665bad37ee9"}

The man in the lifeguard chair is treating the office job as if it was his usual job (hence the oddity of the lifeguard's chair), and telling the other man that he'll only be working in the office for the summer, just as a typical lifeguard job would be.", "instance_id": "3ebf030134fcc8218c62e8465e33d887"}

The joke is that CX (Roman numeral for 110) is her speed, and XXV (Roman numeral for 25) is the speed limit. So the Centurion is saying \"You can tell the judge why you were doing 110 in a 25\" (speed zone).

The therapist asking about \"final thoughts\" is a pun, since \"final thoughts\" are a therapy-related phase, but \"final\" can also refer to something related to death (namely, the person would presumably be dead in the casket).", "instance_id": "2c5d5d396430ea49c2ff6444cae7076b"}

Normally, \"obscene\" is used to describe something offensive or inappropriate, like profanity. In this case, the person is referring to the strange symbols on the clock as \"obscene\" because they are hard to understand, implying that the work hours in this office environment must be difficult to deal with due to the unconventional clock setup.", "instance_id": "c684697888fcef54d12d6dec2224f5e9"}

The humorous twist in this cartoon refers to the fact that the cowboy is now isolated on a deserted island, and there's quite literally no one else to share the space with.

Most people would be fearful in her position, but instead, she casually offers him a drink as if he were just another fellow patron. The phrase \"I've got a few minutes to kill\" plays on the idea of spending time with death (as Satan is a symbol of death) as well as its everyday usage of passing time idly.", "instance_id": "bce26017f599ab76613e17233c4ca526"}

The caption \"Now who's laughing all the way\" is a sarcastic reference to the lyrics of the Christmas carol \"Jingle Bells\" - where the phrase \"laughing all the way\" is used to describe the joy of a sleigh ride.

The haircut reference, implying the man with the bow accidentally \"cut\" his hair in a previous attempt, shows his skepticism and concern about the likelihood of a successful shot.

It's a playful take on the idea that even a divine being like God might have health concerns, and visits the doctor for a checkup, while the doctor reassures God that there's no need to worry.

The man suggests continuing their discussion over a \"hot barrel of coffee,\" which escalates the humor by imagining another item (the coffee) being extremely large as well, following the pattern of the other objects in the office.

Car salesmen are known for using persuasive tactics and pushy sales pitches to get customers to buy a car on the spot. The salesman is ignoring the bizarre and monstrous appearance of the car, still insisting on making a sale, as if the monster-like features are not a big deal to the potential buyers.", "instance_id": "359640ab388068409de7897dfeff1e8f"}

In the caption, the speaker applies the idea of a short-lived bubble to the man turning into bubbles, suggesting he has a similarly short life expectancy. The humor comes from the bizarre situation and the nonchalant way they discuss the bubble man's fate.", "instance_id": "b247655c8111e15816bf99a1808d4753"}

The scene conjures the common trope of bar jokes that usually start with \"A priest, a rabbi, and a minister (or some other characters) walk into a bar,\" which gives the bartender's reaction a meta-awareness that serves as the punchline to the cartoon.", "instance_id": "dbe845baf73e5d0ddd1bb3ee1ddd3522"}

The joke is that even a superhero like Mr. Fantastic has to work as a waiter during the recession, and he is using his superpower to maintain social distancing while serving the food to the couple.", "instance_id": "3263c99c80d8f9ae7741eed96207abbb"}

In this case, a cop is actually hiding in the room but on a horse, so the phrase humorously changes to \"I smell a horse,\" adding an element of ridiculousness to the situation.", "instance_id": "85337a5d3c4ce8321d0d475a290f0a1e"}

The statement from one of the cave people is a humorous prediction that the cave person entering the sand building will surely mention their discovery of fire within a few minutes, as a way to boast or show off.

An angel running for a political position in heaven seemingly doesn't have to worry about Medicare anymore as it has no relevance to the immortal beings.

The joke here is that instead of using modern technology or methods for recording meeting notes or minutes, the people are resorting to an old-fashioned and ridiculous solution - having parrots on their shoulders to mimic and remember the conversation.

However, the presence of a food truck inside their living room is both absurd and unexpected. The humor lies in turning the casual suggestion of trying \"that new place\" into something out of the ordinary since the \"new place\" is unexpectedly inside their own home.", "instance_id": "dc52a0a2c2eb62ee3f05690e3349fb59"}

This joke flips that relationship, as one of the animals undergoing therapy implies it has secrets it doesn't want the fish to overhear.

The situation in the cartoon, where the man is cut into three pieces but still alive, appears like a surrealistic artwork. The joke is that the doctor is diagnosing the man's condition as if it were a real medical ailment, but in fact, it's just an absurd, surreal scenario that wouldn't happen in real life.", "instance_id": "8076ba1f05c0ea6f2892aef428a389f2"}

The joke comes from the doctor mistaking the shadow puppet of a bunny for an actual patient, asking the absurd question whether they are a duck or rabbit.

It's funny because Sisyphus, who is facing a much greater challenge than the father, seems to comment on the father's relatively easy task, forging a humorous connection between myth and mundane.", "instance_id": "a5673ae6e21ef46ff0aabe4d1dcf34c6"}

The phrase \"I don't mind\" implies that the speaker is okay with accommodating Harald's allergy, but finds it amusing that such an issue would arise among tough Viking warriors.", "instance_id": "f62415a73d26ecd3035e4b78b572d48b"}

The fact that they are likely talking to each other on their cell phones suggests that they can't really be separated nor can they accept being close together, creating a paradox that makes the scene comical.", "instance_id": "e12b82ef89033408a4461b326af98f1d"}

But, in this scene, these people are sitting directly on the table, which is a much more disrespectful treatment of the furniture than any damage a drink might do. The ridiculousness of someone asking to use coasters in this situation highlights the fact that people are blatantly disrespecting the table.

The presence of laptops implies that the ducks are supposed to be learning or working, but the speaker suggests that it's the computers making them appear productive.

The humor comes from the king's impulsive decision to behead the groundskeeper, which has its unintended consequences and leaves the throne room looking austere with cacti instead of more refined or well-maintained plants.", "instance_id": "f58dd442dafe2644099549c1f363ba66"}

However, in this case, the bearded man is holding a balloon instead of a gun, turning the nickname into a joke by implying that he is child-like or naive because of his \"weapon\" choice.

The idea is that the colon specialist is dressed in a submarine suit because they are about to be miniaturized, like in the sci-fi movie \"Fantastic Voyage,\" to enter the patient's body and treat their colon.

The ice fisherman's idea to use beer as bait is humorously suggesting that the reason the person fell in was because they were drunk.

The caption is ironic because the bartender yells at the man, insinuating that they don't need a health inspector, when the abnormal multiple chalk outlines on the floor suggest that something is indeed wrong and would warrant a health inspector's visit.

The general with a paper printing out of his chest is a playful visual pun, connecting two distinct ideas: the \"war on drugs\" phrase to describe the fight against illegal drugs, and a general serving at CVS - literal but incongruous.

The devil, who is known for deception, is being accused of cheating in a card game against the suited man, with the \"winnings\" being the souls of the unfortunate people arriving in hell.

The lion tamer is inside the cage as if he is a performer, while one of the animals is placed in a human-like situation, using a phone and speaking.

An often-cited characteristic that people (and dating apps) use as a clich\u00e9 to describe interests is 'loving long walks along the beach'. It's then humorous because his comment about disliking long walks on the beach is explained by the fact he's in high heels, which would make such a walk uncomfortable.

The phrase \"I wear the pants but my wife controls them\" is a humorous way of saying that his wife is the one who calls the shots in their relationship.

The absurdity lies in the fact that grilling isn't allowed on the subway, yet the man casually offers \"to go\" options as if it were a normal practice.", "instance_id": "865d39d2d1a32ca9195d82846b82a82d"}

Referring to the bird's size and appearance, one colleague reminisces, as if talking about a former office intern. This is funny because typically, interns later grow into prominent positions within the company hierarchy (unlike birds, which grow bigger in size, but are unable to do work in an office environment).", "instance_id": "420f9629e1fbebf9fdaa481c151088a2"}

The joke highlights the difficulties and frustrations people often face when interacting with their insurance providers, as if it literally caused a \"fire\" to ignite and threaten the doctor-patient relationship.", "instance_id": "b617c868dc9671e38dc4a86eb6c155d5"}

The woman at the bar is making a flirtatious comment, referencing his plight like an inside joke by asking if he often struggles this way. The humor comes from the contrast between the casual flirting and the eternity of his task.", "instance_id": "898eeacf0a5d76f3c9f399841099adfe"}

But in this context, she is referencing the literal astronaut suits the two men are wearing, and commenting on how unusual or out of place they seem at a party. The phrase \"oddly suited\" is a clever play on words that highlights the strange attire of the astronauts at a social event where such attire is not the norm.", "instance_id": "a40554018adb5a484201f16c37119ba1"}

This meeting is still boring.\n\nExplain the joke/how the caption relates to the cartoon in 2-3 sentences.", "response": "Here's my best explanation: The joke is a play on the idea that people often find work meetings dull and uninteresting. Someone (probably the speaker) suggested that conducting the meeting naked might liven things up, but the humor lies in the irony that, despite the nudity, the meeting remains just as boring as before.", "instance_id": "45e0cc5656db543aacae935a7f598cc9"}

In this situation, the joke is enhanced by the fact that the reader is a rat, a creature that is not expected to read in the first place - so the idea of the rat being unable to read is humorously literal.", "instance_id": "dbd72ec061a518162cff7b6122e143a9"}

The phrase suggests that doing good deeds might not always matter if they're based on misguided intentions, and in this scene, the road literally shows people being herded by devils into hell through a manhole, indicating that even if someone has good intentions, they might still end up in hell, represented by the sewers.", "instance_id": "e747977a1833e7ca9a8c4963dddb8a14"}

In a few miles, they switch to binary.\n\nExplain the joke/how the caption relates to the cartoon in 2-3 sentences.", "response": "Here's my best explanation: A play on the concept of \"mile markers\", which drivers use to determine their distance traveled. In this cartoon, the mile markers are replaced by Roman numerals, which can be more difficult to read than regular numbers. The joke is further extended when the driver mentions that it's going to switch to binary soon, making it even more difficult to understand the distance they've traveled.", "instance_id": "4a967d579d62fd954dc858c76191a332"}

The caption suggests that the customer ordered a bear-related dish, and the joke is that the presence of a bear in the restaurant is the outcome of someone trying (and presumably failing) to catch it because it's on the menu, creating an absurd and amusing situation.", "instance_id": "1191ee2316c99dedfea37bad1d951a7c"}

The caption quips that the \"new rug\" \u2014 which should already be made of wool and ready to use \u2014 actually consists of living sheep, and therefore requires \"assembly\" or the shearing and processing of their wool to create the rug, making the scene humorous due to its absurdity.", "instance_id": "4ad3744760bc0f8e4780d67a2e193030"}

The joke lies in the juxtaposition of Hulk's anger as he yells \"RELAX!\" while forcing someone into a wall, which contrasts with the peaceful ideals of yoga.", "instance_id": "69ec803d4a82886cead39b70eccf8695"}

In the cartoon, a sword is stuck in a desk instead of a pen---an unusual sight in an office setting. The humorous twist is that one of the men acknowledges the usual superiority of the pen but can't help admiring a desk with a sword in it because of the unexpected and badass visuals.", "instance_id": "ad50e8f1c4181a5a0537c46de0cc31ba"}

Here, the couple is experiencing an absurd, mirrored reality where their neighbors (and their activities) are copied in the sky above them. The wife concludes that selling their air rights was a bad decision which led to this surreal situation.", "instance_id": "e169d9a6c064a53217278de016d444cc"}

The joke here is that the man is literally \"planting\" invoices or financial documents, hoping to grow something metaphorically delicious or profitable.

The scene suggests that the woman got rid of the goats in the house, and the man is feeling shocked. The caption hints that the man will inevitably come back to the goats during sweater season, seeking their wool for warmth, so despite the unusual situation, the goats still have a practical purpose.", "instance_id": "ddfd361513b8b0c3cbd65f7fb869ffbc"}

In this case, the musicians are animals and the sound engineer hopes to complete the music album without the common canine distraction, which would disturb the recording session.", "instance_id": "d84f2274a34475bd941791652206d32a"}

The phrase \"You're not in Kansas anymore\" is a quote from the movie, which is repurposed to emphasize the dramatic shift in context from their original story.

The angel is implying that they died because they didn't wear a seat belt in the Batmobile (a fictional vehicle from Batman comics and movies). This is ironic because people usually imagine causes of death to be more serious or significant, not a simple decision like not wearing a seatbelt.", "instance_id": "e7240fdc9dbc656231da740e3b2745f1"}

The joke is that someone is running late or missing, and the person at the desk suggests to start without the missing person there, which is humorous because it makes light of the apparent urgency of the situation.", "instance_id": "f0aeca5e7a6b53d36694064c7f3b5387"}

The tuba players appear to be discussing when one of them should \"come in\" or join with their musical part, while simultaneously exiting the elevator.

In a typical business setting, this phrase would be for welcoming new employees to the company.

The cook, frustrated with the mess in the kitchen, suggests he would have preferred to slay the dragon (which is a knight's job) while the knight should take on the less glamorous task of cooking. The humor lies in the unexpected role reversal and the implication that the knight's involvement in the kitchen led to the mess.", "instance_id": "7d21e6658835fea4096b7af9c3ca36eb"}

In the cartoon, the man's psychological burden is manifested as a literal and enormous weight on him.

The caption \"Well, then, it's unanimous\" simply implies that everyone at the meeting is in agreement, but there's no joke or humorous aspect because the cartoon is a rather ordinary depiction of a board room meeting.

In this absurd situation, the golfers are faced with tanks ready to attack, implying it's dangerous for them to continue playing.

The woman, sarcastically referring to \"free will\" being overrated, acknowledges her role of being a puppet under someone's control.

In the context of an office, it's unlikely that there was a picture of a live animal like a giraffe.

The caption alludes to the man potentially being worried about missing an important sports game, and the woman is reassuring him that they can watch it later, recorded on their DVR.

The situation is humorously reversed, suggesting that instead of needing to speak in ways for our pets to understand, the human now must avoid using straightforward language to address lunch and walks.

Cavemen, who represent prehistoric civilization, seem to be critical of the hole dug in the ground as if it's a new architectural concept. This is funny because we know cavemen wouldn't live in high-rises, but simple holes also would have been basic survival menas in their time.

The man and woman under the umbrella are at the beach, seemingly choosing \"hell\" instead of getting wet.

The snake with the human buttocks may be an evolution of the biblical snake that deceived Adam and Eve. The humor emerges from the snake's possessiveness and jealousy over Adam's looks, despite the snake's bizarre appearance.", "instance_id": "c8a52a693d69ec46592831ea592d67d1"}

However, in the cartoon, he is dressed as a king, showing a humorous contradiction in his supposed desire to blend in with everyday people.", "instance_id": "c113550f5ec8378089129ab98ad0182e"}

In this case, the man has a massive safe attached to him, which is absurd enough, but the humorous twist is that it's not even his luggage, making the situation even more frustrating and ridiculous.", "instance_id": "70071924e6b209e8fb0726e1c3dc751e"}

The joke comes from the nonchalant suggestion by the woman that instead of calling a priest or paranormal expert for an exorcism, maybe the plumber, the person who usually deals with tub issues, could solve the supernatural problem.", "instance_id": "294fa8d32e184ce96c21f952cfe6b194"}

In the cartoon, the man is trying to argue that this agreement applies even after death, as they are both in their coffins. He's playfully or sarcastically suggesting that they should still have a connection or conversational relationship despite being buried and clearly dead.", "instance_id": "967b12adff2de58bc09c146fc902b7de"}

The punchline relates to the modern frustration with healthcare networks. It humorously implies that Humpty couldn't get help from them because they were \"out-of-network,\" meaning they were not covered by his healthcare plan, turning his nursery rhyme crisis into a real-world situation.", "instance_id": "230c5df0cd96686fe848eb85c45936d5"}

However, the joke here is that the doctor is using an absurdly large magnifying glass, which, if exposed to sunlight, could actually create a burning effect through the magnification of light.

First, it suggests that the man's reflection, which appears to be Abraham Lincoln, might be causing the man to think he has some connection or is somehow embodying Lincoln. Second, it references a historical event, as Lincoln was assassinated at a theater while watching a play. So, when the man says \"let's skip the play,\" he is humorously trying to avoid the same fate as Lincoln.", "instance_id": "fc65750f1e2ba470863b8734d555f565"}

The husband in the cartoon is stuck to the ceiling as if he's taken helium shots, and the wife seems annoyed as if she warned him beforehand. The humor comes from the absurdity of someone actually floating away because they consumed too much helium, while also relating it to the typical disagreements between couples.", "instance_id": "b3061cd222429fb032beb62dedc1d3f2"}

However, in this cartoon, the individuals forming the firing squad are dressed in various styles of everyday clothing, which suggests that they may be ordinary citizens or volunteers. The caption is a light-hearted comment on this observation, implying that the group must be struggling to recruit official members, and thus had to resort to enlisting random people in order to fulfill their duties.", "instance_id": "1335e4524eab6bef4102a9eb49909f5c"}

The joke lies in the absurdity of the situation and the punchline suggesting that if they had kids as extra rowers, this nonsensical method of moving the car could actually be more efficient.", "instance_id": "ed8198a39e9b52f24b9dc20c830f78b9"}

One lizard is interviewing the other while a meteorite is approaching the Earth, which in this cartoon universe, is an impending event that could be a serious problem. The irony is that neither lizard is aware of the incoming meteorite, but the question itself suggests that they should be able to observe and react to such unforeseen catastrophic events.", "instance_id": "7f539af46e11f9a39129769c605476a4"}

But in this cartoon, the term \"big case\" is used as a pun to reference the unusually long briefcase the three businessmen are carrying.

In this case, the knight seems to have \"drunkenly\" impaled the car door, and is explaining that he only had a couple of meads a while ago, an attempt to downplay his \"intoxication.\" The joke is that instead of a modern driver in a car, it's a medieval knight on a horse who's being questioned about his behavior.", "instance_id": "0cf8fd0b1f5428c95bd02605bd9c2bf4"}
